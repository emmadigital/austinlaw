Just released, this short guide let’s you in on how insurance companies think when it comes to truth and justice. This guide is essential for [anyone who wants to handle their accident claim on their own ](/resources/31-quick-tips-for-handling-your-own-texas-personal-injury-car-accident-settlement/)or even just good to read before you [let the insurance company take your statement](/should-i-talk-to-the-insurance-adjuster-after-an-accident/).

In the past, we’ve only given this guide out to people who contacted our offices for our other [free accident reports](/free-accident-books/), but now we’re giving it away to everyone because it’s just that important.
