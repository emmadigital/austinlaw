### Motor Vehicle Accidents – An Overview

If you are involved in a **Texas car accident**, and you feel that it was caused by the negligence of the other driver, then you may have cause for a lawsuit.

[Negligence in Texas](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/injury-law/negligence-in-texas/ "Negligence in Texas") is determined to be a factor based on proper lookout. This means that every driver on the road must observe all circumstances of driving in order to prevent an automobile accident. The failure of a driver to pay attention to the road and other drivers can result in a car accident because of negligence. Generally, people who operate automobiles must exercise “reasonable care under the circumstances.” A failure to use reasonable care is considered negligence. A person who negligently operates a vehicle may be required to pay for harm to a person or property, caused by his or her negligence. The injured party, known as the plaintiff, is required to prove that the defendant was negligent, that the negligence caused the accident, and that the accident caused the plaintiff’s injuries.

You may need the help of a lawyer in order to prove that the other driver was negligent if you were involved in an [automobile accident in Texas](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/personal-injury-services/car-accidents/ "Car Accidents"). This can be a complex issue, especially if the accident resulted in serious injury to you or a passenger in your vehicle. You also have to prove that you suffered [bodily injury](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/personal-injury-services/austin-soft-tissue-damage-attorneys/ "Austin Soft Tissue Damage Attorneys") in the accident and if you choose to deal with the insurance company on your own, you may have difficulty receiving the compensation which you deserve.  Lawyers are more skilled at and are better equipped to sue for compensation in a car accident.

1. Loss of income because you are unable to work, permanently or for a period of time
2. Medical expenses

The court may reduce the amount of your claim if the other driver claims that you are also responsible for the car accident, which is why you need the services of an [experienced auto accident lawyer.](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/meet-us/andrew-traub/)
