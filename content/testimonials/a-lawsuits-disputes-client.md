A Lawsuits & Disputes Client





October 14, 2008



Andrew has handled all our litigation and other needs in an efficient and professional manner. He makes sure he understands the facts and then researches the law, and in the result his advice is always sound. He is not like some lawyers we have used in the past, who try to add unjustified hours onto their billings, and in this respect he is scrupulously honest, to the extent that we sometimes feel that he is undercharging us. We have tremendous confidence in using Andrew as our attorney.
