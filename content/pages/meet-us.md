## Austin Personal Injury Law Firm Profile

The Traub Law Office was established in 2003. We are a [personal injury law firm in Austin](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/), and we concentrate on helping people that have been injured in car, [truck](/practice-areas/truck-accident-lawyer/), [motorcycle](practice-areas/motorcycle-accident-attorney/), bicycle accidents. We also help people who have been [attacked by a dog](/practice-areas/dog-bite-injury-lawyer/) and who have [fallen in an unsafe area](/practice-areas/slip-and-fall-injury-lawyers/) open to the public.

We have been practicing personal injury law in Texas for many, many years, and we are willing to go the distance for our clients. The distance for us means all the way to a jury verdict if that is what it takes to get you justice. Even though 90% of our cases do not go to trial, we prepare every case as if it will go to trial because in our experience we know that is what it takes to get you the justice you deserve.

When you hire us, you will get a lawyer who can speak to you, not a paralegal. If you want to speak to the attorney handling your case, no problem. When we are not in court, then we are in the office. Lawyers work on your case, not paralegals. Attorneys speak to witnesses, speak to your treating physicians, and speak to the insurance companies. At all steps of the process you have a lawyer working on your file. Not many firms can say that because most firms employee people without any formal legal training to handle their clients’ claims.

We don’t take on every case so that we can give more personal attention to you. The [TV lawyers](/large-personal-injury-firms-may-bad-case/) brag about how many thousands of auto accident cases they have settled. We do not want to settle thousands of dubious personal injury cases. We want one-to-one interaction with our clients and to give them great representation. We don’t throw cases to the wall and see which ones stick. We do not settle your [serious injury case](/practice-areas/serious-personal-injury/) for less than it is worth because we do not have time to file suit and take it to trial to get you the maximum value. When we take on your accident case, it is with the expectation it will be tried. If it settles, that is great but we are not afraid to take your case all the way to the jury to get you the justice you deserve. It is critical that you ask the law firm you hire, how many lawyers and staff they have and how many active cases they have. More than ten cases per staff member is a red flag. Keep in mind that only lawyers can try cases and ask them how many claims are currently in litigation. If they have lots of cases but few in litigation, that is a red flag that they are compromising the clients’ claims to get a quick settlement. If they have lots of lawsuits but few lawyers, how will they fit you in?

We strive to keep you updated at all phases of your claim, and if you have any questions, you can speak to an actual lawyer during office hours and clients can speak to us after hours through our cell phones. Many legal firms office out of virtual offices, they do not even have regular offices and work out their house, renting and office by the hour to impress their potential clients. We are not that kind of fly-by-night. Nor are we the firm where you can never get in touch with your attorney and are always speaking to the receptionist of the paralegal who has no legal training.

We do not take on an exorbitant amount of cases only to give the bare minimum. We will do everything that we reasonable can to help them during this time. In fact, we have been successful in this endeavor before. We help our clients receive the necessary funding for surgery, and other associated bills.
