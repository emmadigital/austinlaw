In August, the Atlanta Journal Constitution broke a story about\
Progressive Insurance Company’s use of private investigators in a\
shocking manner. The story, which is unfortunately no longer available\
online, stated as follows:

> When a new couple arrived at Southside Christian Fellowship\
> in August 2005, members welcomed them with open arms. Soon, the new\
> couple talked their way into private group support sessions…During\
> the private talks, church members confessed abortions, sexual\
> orientation issues, drug addictions and other dark secrets. No one knew\
> the couple wasn’t actually interested in joining the church. Instead,\
> they were private investigators hoping two church members…would spill\
> something they could use to discredit the pair in an ongoing lawsuit\
> over a traffic accident. The private eyes even tape-recorded the\
> sessions.

Immediately after the story broke, the Progressive CEO offered an apology, calling the situation “appalling.”

But Progressive is now singing a different tune. In a lawsuit filed by the personal injury victims, Progressive is now asserting that the conduct was “reasonable.”

It will be interesting to watch and see how this story plays out.
