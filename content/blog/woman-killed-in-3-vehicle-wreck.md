One woman died Tuesday shortlye before 11 a.m. in a wreck at Bee Cave Road near MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1).

Sgt. Dane Baker of the Department of Public Safety said a gold Toyota pickup was traveling west on Bee Cave in the far right lane when it was clipped in the back by a white Mazda RX in the left lane, causing the truck to spin into the eastbound lane of Bee Cave. Baker said the truck was then hit on the side by an eastbound Toyota Yaris. The driver of the Yaris, Linda Gail Hartner, 54, of Austin, was pronounced dead at the scene.

The man driving the 2007 Toyota pickup, RIchard Hanson, 68, of Austin, was taken to University Medical Center at Brackenridge. The driver of the Mazda was not injured, Baker said.
