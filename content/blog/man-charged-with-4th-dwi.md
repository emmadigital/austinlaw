A New Braunfels man was arrested Sunday in connection with what police say is his fourth charge of driving while intoxicated, according to an arrest affidavit.

Austin police say a witness reported a gold pickup on northbound Interstate 35 swerving between lanes and cutting off other drivers. According to the affidavit, officers saw the truck nearly hit a car and a motorcycle.

Edward Amaro, 43, was arrested after he failed a field sobriety test, according to the affidavit. He was in the Travis County jail on Tuesday with bail set at $12,000.
