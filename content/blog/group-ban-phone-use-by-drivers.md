A national safety group is advocating a total ban on cell phone use while driving, saying that the practice is dangerous and leads to fatalities. The congressionally chartered National Safety Council says that states should ban drivers from using hand-held and hands-free cell phones and that businesses should prohibit employees from using cell phones while driving on the job. No state currently bans all cell phone use while driving. Six states â€” California, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Utah and Washington â€” and the District of Columbia ban the use of hand-held cell phones behind the wheel, according to the Insurance Institute.
