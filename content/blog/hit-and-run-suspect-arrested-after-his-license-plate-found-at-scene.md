A [pedestrian](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/practice-areas/pedestrian-accident-lawyers/) was [seriously injured](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/practice-areas/serious-personal-injury/) while crossing the street in East Austin by a vehicle that took off, but not without leaving its front license plate behind, according to the driverâ€™s arrest affidavit.

Police responded to a call at about 2:48 a.m. Saturday of a person possibly hit by a car. The victim was crossing E 12th Street on Pleasant Valley Road on a pedestrian right-of-way with a protected walk signal when a vehicle struck his left side, causing him to hit his head on the pavement, the affidavit said.

Austin police have identified Dejuan Strong, 24, as the driver of the vehicle, the affidavit said.

According to the affidavit, the victim told police that a man got out of a silver car and asked if he was OK. When the victim didnâ€™t respond, the man saidÂ â€œI have to go back to my carâ€ and took off, the document said.

A witness told police, similarly, that the driver approached the victim and asked if 911 needed to be called before getting in his car, the affidavit said. The witness said the car left, driving around the man who was still lying on the intersection, the document said.

The victim was transported to Dell Seton Medical Center, the affidavit said.

A license plate was left at the scene and was found to be registered to a silver 2007 Honda Accord, the affidavit said. The car matched the witnessâ€™ description of the vehicle and was registered to a home about a mile from where the incident occurred, the document said.

Police were also able to track the number of the 911 call. The caller identified himself as â€œJared,â€ but it was found that the number belong to Strong, the document said.

Officers went to the registered address of the vehicle to speak with the owner when they saw the car enter the parking lot, the affidavit said. Police detained Strong, who was in the driverâ€™s seat of the car, the document said.

Strong told police he was the one who called 911 but not the person who hit the victim, the affidavit said. When police asked why he didnâ€™t use his real name with emergency dispatchers, he said he didnâ€™t want to, the document said. Strong also said his license plate must have fallen off in the area and that was why it was on the scene, the document said.

Strong was charged with failure to stop and render aid with bail set at $10,000. Jail records showed Strong was no longer being held in Travis County Jail Monday.
