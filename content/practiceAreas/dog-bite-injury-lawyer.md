When a dog attacks, their teeth leave jagged scars and tearing of the skin. As a result, the skin does not heal as well over time as it would if it were cut by a knife. In addition to the long-term scarring, the bite can often cause nerve damage to the area. An *experienced dog bite injury lawyer* will talk to your doctors to make sure you are getting the treatment you need.
