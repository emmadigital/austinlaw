Three people were taken to University Medical Center Brackenridge on Thursday with serious injuries after a collision on Interstate 35 South near Texas 130 toll Road.

Two people who werenâ€™t wearing seat belts were thrown from the vehicle and flown to Brackenridge in critical condition.

A third person was taken to Brackenridge by ground transportation in serious condition.

Honestly, why do people not wear seat belts?
