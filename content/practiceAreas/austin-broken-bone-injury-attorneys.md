Depending on the position and severity of the break, a broken bone can alter a person’s life forever. A broken bone can hurt surrounding tissue, veins or organs. Even a seemingly modest injury to the bone can have long term consequences. For example, over time a person may develop injuries to adjacent bones or soft tissue or develop traumatic arthritis that causes pain and limits mobility. The seriousness of this type of injury makes hiring experienced broken bone injury attorneys very important.
