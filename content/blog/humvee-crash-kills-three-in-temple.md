A National Guard Humvee lost control on Interstate 35 on Wednesday, triggering a six-vehicle crash that killed the soldier driving the Humvee and two other drivers, including one from Austin, authorities said.

The Humvee was traveling south in the rain near the small town of Troy, north of Temple, about 11 a.m. when it went airborne, cleared the center barrier and hit an oncoming car and an 18-wheeler, according to the Department of Public Safety. The rig then crashed into a truck towing a trailer and a garbage truck.

Troy police Sgt. David Lowry told the Temple Daily Telegram that the victims were the Humvee driver, Altha Gibson, 21, of DeSoto; the driver of the 18-wheeler, Donald Johnson, 44, of Burleson; and the driver of the car, Douglas Ashcroft, 41, of Austin.
