A 20-year-old man was charged with felony intoxication manslaughter in the death of one of his passengers after a crash Saturday night in northwestern Travis County. According to an arrest affidavit filed Monday, Jose Olvera-Tovar lost control of a Ford Explorer late Saturday on General Williamson Drive near RM 620. The Explorer struck several concrete blocks, was launched into the air and struck a utility pole, according to the affidavit.

Passenger Jose Guillen-Ortiz, 29, died in the wreck. Olvera-Tovar and another passenger were treated for minor injuries at University Medical Center Brackenridge and released before Olvera-Tovar was arrested.
