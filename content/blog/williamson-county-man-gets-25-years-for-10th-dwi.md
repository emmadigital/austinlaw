Wesley Ray Marek, arrested August 11th, 2006, after a Round Rock officer stopped him over a possible traffic violation on Sam Bass Road, was sentenced in Williamson County recently to 25 years in prison after his 10th conviction on driving while intoxicated charges.

The officer found that Marek was wanted in Brown County, almost 100 miles west of Waco, on a probation violation and was driving with a suspended license.

Because he had been convicted of three or more driving while intoxicated charges, the most recent charge was a third-degree felony. In addition, because he had been sentenced to prison at least two previous times, the charge was enhanced to a first-degree felony, punishable by 25 to 99 years or life in prison.
