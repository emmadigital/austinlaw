Two people were killed and one was injured Monday afternoon in a head-on collision on U.S. 290, about four miles west of Johnson City.

An 18-year-old woman driving east on U.S. 290 fell asleep, struck a guard rail and entered oncoming traffic about 1:05 p.m., a Department of Public Safety spokesman said.

The womanâ€™s car collided with a truck, killing Jack Crossly Cobb, 83, and Pearl Waddell Cobb, 82. The 18-year old was taken to University Medical Center Brackenridge in Austin with a broken pelvis and femur and is listed in stable condition.
