A 19-year-old motorcyclist died Wednesday after he crashed into a pickup truck that was pulling out of a drive onto FM 1431, about 2 and a half miles east of Marble Falls, officials said.

Daniel Elites, 19, was killed in the crash, said Robbie Barrera, Department of Public Safety spokeswoman. The crash was reported at 7:55 p.m. Wednesday.

The pickup truckâ€™s driver said she saw headlights at the top of the hill and thought she could turn onto the highway before he reached her, Barrera said. When she drove onto the highway, Elites crashed into the truck and was thrown off his motorcycle.

Witnesses told state troopers that they had seen a motorcyclist speeding and weaving in between cars shortly before the crash, Barrera said. Troopers are still working to determine the speed at which Elites was traveling, she said.
