Several people, including a 4-year-old boy, were injured during a boat collision on Lake Austin at dusk Saturday, according to emergency officials.

The boy was taken to the hospital with a head injury.

The collision occured just before 8 p.m. when one recreational boat ran into the back of another near the Watersedge neighborhood and Mount Bonnell, according to Austin Fire Department Chief Dawn Clopton.

Austin police were investigating late Saturday and had made no arrests. Apparently, one bout was pulling a tube, had stopped, and was struck by the other boat.

Austin-Travis County EMS officials reported that a total of 24 passengers were on the boats and that three, including the boy and one other child, were taken to the hospital. None of the injuries are considered life-threatening.
