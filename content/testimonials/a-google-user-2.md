I came to Andrew after being rear ended in my car. This type of accident has happen to me ad nauseam since I’ve lived in Austin. It has caused serious problems for me. Usually i’m offered a paltry offering from the other person’s insurance company. I decided to try using a lawyer this time around. Andrew took the case even though he thought that we might not get much from the insurance company, since I have been injured from too many of these accidents. He thought I deserved representation. I have been turned down by attorneys before. We got a nice settlement from the insurance company. It was quick and painless. Thank you Andrew.
