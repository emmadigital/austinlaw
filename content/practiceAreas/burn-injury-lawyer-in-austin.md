There are different types of burns which a person can suffer, rated by degree. Each degree is based on the severity of damage to the skin, with first-degree being the most minor and third-degree being the most severe

# First-degree burns

First-degree burns are not too severe. You should still seek medical attention within a short period to avoid cases where your skin will be exposed to more complications. First-degree burns are characterized by redness on the skin with non-blistered skin. They cause minimal damage to the skin hence they are referred to as superficial burns. They affect the outermost part of your skin. Signs of first-degree burns include:

* redness
* minor inflammation, or swelling
* pain
* dry, peeling skin occurs as the burn heals

First degree burns usually heal within 7 to 10 days without scarring. You should see a doctor if the burn affects a more than three inches of your skin or if it’s on your face or a major joint.

## Second-degree burns

Symptoms of second-degree burns include thickening and blisters on your skin. Second-degree burns are more serious than first-degree burns because the damage goes beyond the top layer of the skin. Second-degree burns make the skin blister and become red and sore.

If you leave second-degree burns untreated for long, they can lead to more damage to your skin cells. Blisters formed on the skin can pop open making the situation worse. Over time, fibrinous exudate (thick, soft, scab-like tissue) may develop over the wound.

Seek the services of a medical expert who will bandage the area and apply medication to prevent infections.

Second degree burns can take several weeks to heal. Most heal without scarring but pigment changes to the skin can occur. In extreme cases, skin grafting may be required to fix [scars from burns](/practice-areas/facial-disfigurement-or-scars/).

## Third-degree burns

Third-degree burns are the most severe burn you can experience on your skin. Third-degree burns extend through every layer of the skin. Because the burns are so extensive, nerve damage may occur and the victim may not feel pain in the burned area.

Symptoms of third-degree burns include:

* waxy and white color
* charring
* dark brown color
* raised and leathery texture

Third-degree burns may be permanent. Without surgery, scarring and contracture of the burned area will occur. Get immediate medical treatment.

Third-degree burns carry the most risk for complications, including:

* infections;
* blood loss;
* shock;
* hypothermia;
* hypovolemia;
* and [death](/practice-areas/wrongful-death-attorney/).

## Fourth-degree burns

The burns bear all the symptoms of the third-degree burns, but they extend to damage the bones and tendons.

Extensive damage from burns can lead to problems in deep skin tissues, bones, and organs. Patients may require:

* [surgery](/practice-areas/serious-personal-injury/)
* physical therapy
* rehabilitation
* lifelong assisted care
