  Our client, a 50 year old Indian American woman, slipped and fell on wet paint outside the Ulta Store at the Gateway shopping center near 183/360. Gateway denied liability, pointing to a cone with a “wet paint” sign attached to it in front of the painted area. Our client testified the cone was off to the side when she approached so that she didn’t see it, as she was looking forward and toward the store doors and with a truck blocking her view to the right. As a result of the fall, she had a broken nose (required a nose reduction), a laceration on her forehead that required 8 stitches (and which has left a permanent, though now less noticeable, scar), a temporary injury to her larynx which made her lose her voice for 2 days and was painful for several more, etc. EMS called. No Dx of TBI or concussion, though she definitely exhibited symptoms for several months.

  We put on 5 witnesses – Gateway’s corporate rep, our warnings expert Dr. Gary Nelson, our client’s dance instructor, and then our client and her husband. Gateway steadfastly held that it was our client’s fault, although the evidence showed their guy painted the step around the time the stores opened and not before (although he had punched in at 7 a.m. that day). They literally argued “wet paint is wet.” We argued a single cone in the wrong place was not adequate — and there was no excuse why Gateway could not have put out additional cones or used caution tape.


  Defendant also pointed to their security officer’s report, which contained 3 photos of where the cone was placed after the fall. Unfortunately for us, all the photos were bad for us in that the cone was where it should have been, so we had to rely on our client’s testimony that it was not in that spot when she fell. The good news was that Gateway had to admit they had no pre-fall pictures, and the evidence showed 2 of the 3 photos were taken by our client’s husband and not their guy (even though the report claimed all 3 were taken by their guy). The third photo, which was taken by their guy, did not have a time stamp and we argued it was a CYA photo taken after the fact.


  A big challenge for us was that Gateway had Facebook stalked our client, pulling up various pictures of her smiling months after the accident, as well as some pictures of her dancing at community events in late 2018. We were able to take the sting out of a lot of those by using those same pictures with her dance instructor and her husband, each of which could provide context and a reasonable explanation (distinguishing her pre-fall and post-fall level of fitness and ability, the fact that our client was smiling at her daughter’s graduation a month after the fall doesn’t mean she wasn’t injured, etc.) before Gateway could pull a “gotcha” on our client on cross. Gateway also tried to make a big deal about the fact that our client has taken several international trips with her husband and kids, but our client and her husband came across as sincere about not wanting to “put life on hold” because of an injury, especially when it comes to spending time with family.

  I don’t think Gateway ever made a meaningful offer, even at mediation, as they did not accept the mediator’s proposal of $20k (which the client accepted). Oops. At trial, they argued our client was at least 70% at fault, and if anything, her damages should be valued at $2.5k for past pain, $1k for future pain, and $1k for her past scar (zero for everything else). The jury disagreed:


  Past pain = $75,000


  Future pain = $5,000


  Past impairment = $10,000


  Past mental anguish = $100,000


  Future mental anguish = $10,000


  **TOTAL = $200,000** (plus costs and pre-judgment interest from Oct 2016).

**– CASE DESCRIPTION**

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

> The at-fault driver was exiting a private driveway onto Lamar which is two lanes in either direction. A car was turning left out of that same driveway and she was parked to the right of it. For whatever reason, she turned right into the first lane and then attempted to make a u-turn. My client was going 45 MPH and had no time to stop. It was a hard impact with good front end damage and deployment of the passanger side airbag.
>
> The client went to ADC that day for shoulder and neck pain, got a prescription, and then left for his planned trip to Las Vegas for a week (which was obviously ruined by his pain). In addition, he started to fail pain in his lower back. After he came back, he hired me and I sent him to a chiropractor on a LOP though he had health insurance. He treated for several weeks and his pain went from a self-reported 5 to a 1 but wouldn’t go away, and the chiropractor sent him out for an MRI.
>
> The MRI showed an annular fissure and disc derangement.
>
> He treated a couple more times and then saw a pain management doctor on a LOP after being referred by the chiropractor.
>
> The pain management doctor ended up giving him an ESI shortly before Christmas.
>
> Just after the new year, his sister was in an accident (his fiancé was also in the car). He attempted to pull a fender away from a tire and his LBP got worse for a few days. He got another ESI a few weeks later. He stopped treatment completely seven months after the accident.
>
> He continued to experience a low-level of back pain.
>
> In December 2016, the client was in another accident which was a multi-car collision but he was the last one injured. He was injured and treated for only a month though he testified it was a month or two.
>
> The trial was 2.3 years after the accident with no treatment related to the first accident after the first seven months.
>
> Total medical bills were just over $28,000.
>
> Client lost five days of work worth approximately $2,400.

### Negotiations

The at-fault driver’s insurance was with Progressive. They tendered their policy limit of $30,000.

My client’s under-insured coverage was with Progressive. He carried a $100,000 policy and $5,000 of PIP benefits.

We made an initial demand of $60,000 before we asked for the PIP benefits. My client wanted $10,000 to $15,000 in his pocket after paying attorneys’ fees and the doctors. I felt like that meant we would have to get a total of $15,000 more than the $30,000 collected.

The Progressive adjuster said she felt he had been fully compensated and that the ongoing pain in his back was due to aging. The client was 40 and the MRI showed No disc degeneration. She offered $2,500 but said it could go up.

I then claimed the $5,000 in PIP benefits. The adjuster was not pleased because she said there would be no room to negotiate. I told her she would need to get to five figures to get this settled. She said that wouldn’t happen, so we filed suit.

Both sides waived mediation.

### Trial Summary

First witness was the adjuster. She was on for five minutes. Progressive didn’t dispute liability, at-fault driver 100% at fault, didn’t dispute the treatment was necessary, didn’t dispute the treatment costs were reasonable. Didn’t dispute the 5 days of missed work and $2,400 of lost wages. She also agreed no history of back pain (this was a defense and requested in the jury instructions) and no evidence he didn’t follow his doctors’ orders (requested jury instruction on failure to mitigate).

My client’s fiance was next. I met her and spoke to her the first time for about 30 minutes the Friday before the trial. No prep with her other than to tell her to be ready to talk about health before and after and what the effects were. I told her, don’t just tell us his back hurt, tell stories about incidences she’s observed and the effects. She did very well. She explained the pain came and went – he had better days and worse days.

My client was the last witness. Went through one treatment record before the wreck showing no back pain. Went through select records, including the pull of the fender. Went through MRI (critical record) and discharge record from pain doctor.

### Final Result

Past medicals: $28,288.02 (full)

Future medicals: $64,000

Past pain: $15,000 (about what was asked)

Future pain: $37,500 (about half of what was asked)

Past impairment: $12,500 (just over half of what was asked)

Future impairment: $40,000 (just over half of what was asked)

Lost wages: $2,400
