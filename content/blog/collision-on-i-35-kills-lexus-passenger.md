A passenger in a Lexus sedan was killed when the car he was riding in collided with a stalled tractor-trailer in the southbound lanes of Interstate 35 in San Marcos early Wednesday morning.

According to San Marcos police, the tractor-trailer hit road debris around 2 a.m. which disabled the truck’s air brakes, causing the vehicle to stop in the right south-bound lane of I-35 on the McCarty lane overpass.

Police said 30-year-old Eric Edwin of Cibolo was driving the black Lexus when he collided with the trailer, sending debris into the other lanes.

The front-seat passenger in the sedan, 45-year-old Donald Eugene Wilson of San Marcos, died at the scene. San Marcos-Hays County EMS medics took the driver to St. David’s South Austin Medical Center, where he is expected to recover.

The driver of the tractor-trailer, which was carrying bottled water, was not injured.

Authorities shut down the highway while crews cleared debris and investigators studied the scene, causing traffic delays for several hours until the southbound lanes were reopened at 7:30 a.m.
