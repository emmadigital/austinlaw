A motorcyclist died on Wednesday morning following a crash on North MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1).

The victim, who was in his 30s, was headed south when he collided with at least one other vehicle near RM 2222 around 2:15 a.m.

Austin-Travis County EMS crews were called to the scene to treat the man, but he died from his injuries shortly after the incident and was pronounced dead at the scene.

The southbound lanes of MoPac in the area were shut down for several hours while investigators gathered evidence. It is unknown whether alcohol or speed were factors.
