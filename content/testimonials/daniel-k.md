Daniel K.



July 22, 2015



I suffered a fall at a local Austin restaurant that resulted in serious injury requiring surgery. I believed the restaurant to be at fault for not adequately marking a hidden stairway. Andrew was engaged to handle my case. I found him, at all times, to be prepared and more than competent. He kept me informed on the status of my case, but more importantly, prepared well me for the the activities that would require my participationâ€¦ namely the process of taking depositions. He was there during the mediation negotiations and in the end I received an out of court settlement that I believed to fair and adequate. I would recommend Andrew without hesitation. I for one am a very satisfied customer.
