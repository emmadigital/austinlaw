Athletes, band members, cheerleaders and other **students ages 14 to 18 who take part in strenuous sports** can get a free heart screening Saturday at Heart Hospital of Austin, 3801 N. Lamar Blvd.

The screening, from 8 a.m. to noon, is sponsored by the hospital and Championship Hearts, a charity created by Austin Heart, the doctors’ group that founded the hospital.

Students will receive an echo cardiogram, or ultrasound of the heart, and an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to detect hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a thickening of the heart muscle and a leading cause of sudden death among athletes. The tests also will detect ether conditions, including abnormal heart rhythms.

Volunteer cardiologists from Austin Heart, Children’s Cardiology Associates of Austin and Heart & Vascular of Central Texas will be on hand.

Although there is no charge, a $15 donation is suggested. Registration will be in the hospital lobby. For more information, call 340-7313.
