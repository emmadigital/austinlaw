Trust. That’s the critical ingredient when choosing an attorney– someone you can trust, completely trust, because it is going to be a long, long road in settling your personal injury case. For example, I’ve had two cases with Andrew Traub as my attorney. My first case took over a year to settle and the second took nearly three years. The delay had nothing to do with Andrew– the delay was due to the intentional inertia of the opposing insurance company. The opposition’s strategy, I have come to see, is they want to wear you down and out. That’s where you need to lean on Andrew Traub.

Andrew will get you through. With my two cases with Andrew, in each instance I had a police report that faulted the other driver. You’d think I would not have needed an attorney at all, and yet in each instance the opposing party, even with a police report against them, refused to take responsibility. It was exasperating.

In three years of working with Mr. Traub, I learned a lot. Without equivocation I can vouch that you can count on Andrew Traub to champion your best interest, even if it requires many extra hours on his part (at no cost to you). He will fight and get it right.

I found Mr. Traub to be professional at all times. He is responsive to his clients, timely with his filings, respected among his peers, and he is tenacious.

I could not have done better than Traub Law. I’d rate my satisfaction on trust, professionalism, and results as a perfect 10 out of 10.
