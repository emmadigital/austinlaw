Professional and courteous I highly recommend Andrew Traub for any personal injury work. He was very courteous and professional in the handling of my case. His experience with personal injury law was evident in our first meeting, and throughout the process, Mr. Traub was very communicativeâ€¦quick to respond to emails and phone calls. I will recommend his services to any family and friends. Seriously, before you talk to your insurance (or anyone else) regarding your personal injury claim or settlement, talk to Andrew. He is a polite, professional lawyer that will handle your case as you would expect.
