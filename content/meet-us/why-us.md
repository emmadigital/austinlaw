<!--StartFragment-->

There are many, many personal injury lawyers and attorneys to choose from in Austin if you’ve been injured due to someone else’s negligence or reckless actions. So how do you pick the right Texas lawyer for you?Â We discuss many of the factors in our [free accident report](/resources/free-texas-accident-report/), but if you don’t have time to read it, here are some of the differences you’ll find with our firm:

## Lawyers, not Paralegals

When you hire us, you get a lawyer who you can speak to, not a paralegal. Want to speak to the attorney handling your case? No problem, when we’re not in court we’re in the office. Lawyers work on your cases, not paralegals.Â Attorneys order your medical records, speak to witnesses, speak to your treating physicians, speak to the insurance companies. At all steps of the process you have a lawyer working on your file. Not many firms can say that because most use people without any formal legal training to handle their clients’ claims.

## Experience

We’ve been practicing personal injury law in Texas for quite a while and we have and are willing to go the distance for our clients – the distance meaning all the way to a jury verdict if that’s what it takes to get you justice.Â While most cases settle before suit is filed, or at mediation after suit is filed, a few do go to trial because the insurance company just can’t handle your truth.Â We prepare every case as if it will go to trial, even though 90+% of them don’t.Â We are experienced enough to know that’s what it takes to get you the justice you deserve.

## We Don’t Take on Every Case – More Attention to You

The TV lawyers brag about how many thousands of auto accident cases they have settled.Â We don’t want to settle thousands of dubious personal injury cases.Â We want one-to-one interaction with our clients and to give them great representation.Â We don’t throw cases against the wall and see which ones stick.Â We don’t settle your personal injury case for less than it’s worth because we don’t have time to file suit and take it to trial to get you the maximum value.Â When we take on your accident case, it’s with the expectation it will be tried.Â If it settles, that’s great, but we aren’t afraid to take your case all the way to the jury to get you the justice you deserve.Â It’s critical that you ask the law firm you hire how many lawyers and staff they have and how many active cases they have.Â More than ten cases per staff member is red flag.Â Keep in mind that only lawyers can try cases and ask them how many claims are currently in litigation.Â If they have lots of cases but few in litigation, that’s a red flag that they are compromising the clients’ claims to get a quick settlement.Â If they have lots of lawsuits but few lawyers, how are they going to fit you in?

## Free Property Damage Claim Assistance

When you’ve been injured, the last thing you want is to have to deal with the auto insurance company.Â And that’s especially true when it comes to having your car or truck repaired or replaced.Â The insurance companies aren’t exactly honest about your legal rights and what you are entitled to claim, whether you are entitled to rental reimbursement, how much that should be, etc.Â And they will exhaust you with their tactics.Â Many personal injury attorneys won’t help you with your property damage claim, and many others will charge you a fee.Â We don’t – it’s free to our clients.

## Discounts for Veterans and Active Military

We’re sick of seeing people who defend our country and our liberties at the risk of their lives come back only to be injured in a car crash.Â So we’re doing what we can for them, which is working at below our normal contingency rates.Â If you are a veteran, that’s just one more reason to hire us.

## Discounts for Drunk Driver Accidents

Drunk drivers are a menace to society and often cause horrific, long-term (even lifelong) injuries to their victims.Â If you were injured by a drunk driver, we’ll donate a portion of our fees to Mothers Against Drunk Driving to help fight this scourge.

## Free Accident Report

We wrote the book in Austin before the other personal injury attorneys started copying us.Â Without even having to speak to us, you can get a copy of our free injury guide which details how to hire a lawyer, what not to say to the insurance companies, whether you can handle your claim yourself, and many more freebies.Â You should get this book before you speak to any lawyer or the insurance company.

## Free Referrals

We’re confident of our track record and ability to help injured people.Â But we’re also happy to provide referrals to other personal injury attorneys who we respect.Â If you don’t choose us, at least you’ll be guided by an experienced personal injury attorney to another lawyer who we respect.

## Track Record of Success

Throughout the years, the verdicts and settlements that have been achieved by our firm speak for themselves, although we always like it when our clients do the speaking. All our case results have been obtained through hard work on behalf of our team â€“ through sheer hard work, legal skill and commitment to our clients. We know that you hire an attorney for the simple purpose of getting results and at our firm, we are fully committed to ensuring that’s exactly what we strive for. [Read some of our testimonials here](/testimonials/).

## Client Communication

We strive to keep you updated at all phases of your claim, and if you have any questions, you can speak to an actual lawyer during office hours and clients can speak to us after hours through our cell phones.Â Many legal firms office out of virtual offices – they don’t even have regular offices and work out of their house, renting an office by the hour to impress their potential clients.Â We’re not that kind of fly-by-night.Â Nor are we the firm where you can never get in touch with your attorney and are always speaking to the receptionist of the paralegal who has no legal training.

## Commitment to the Case

When you are entering into a personal injury case, it is important to realize that this is not a cheap endeavor. In fact, it can have significant cost (we pay the legal expenses). You therefore need a lawyer on your side who is invested in the outcome of your case and is willing to invest in the case. At our firm, we know that to get results, you sometimes need to spend money. We are prepared to invest whatever it takes into hiring the very best experts and doing whatever else is required to make sure that you have your best foot forward when we go to trial.

## Medical Assistance

Many of our clients do not have health insurance.Â That makes them especially vulnerable to the insurance company quick-cash-settlement scam.Â If you don’t have health insurance, we work with several funding companies that will help you get the treatment you need so you can recover and get back to working and enjoying life.

## Commitment You

Unlike other firms, we are not interested in running a legal mill. We don’t take on an exorbitant amount of cases only to give the bare minimum. We will do everything that we reasonably can to help them during this time. In fact, we have been successful in this endeavor before â€“ helping our clients receive the necessary funding for surgery, funeral expenses and other associated bills.
