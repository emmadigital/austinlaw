I got rear-ended and came to the Traub Law Office because I didn’t want to spend endless hours on the phone with the other person’s insurance company, and then get hassled into a settlement that doesn’t even cover my basic medical expenses like has happened in the past. This time around, after Mr Traub agreed to take my case, things were simple and effortless on my end. He is trustworthy, thorough, efficient, and a great communicator. I am content with the settlement we reached, and grateful for the peace of mind of having all the details of the case handled by a true professional. I highly recommend this office.
