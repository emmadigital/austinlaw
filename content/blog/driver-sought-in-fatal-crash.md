Austin police are still investigating a crash from Tuesday morning in which a pedestrian, Ernest Lee Moss, was killed.

Moss, 63, of Austin was hit by a gray Chevrolet Suburban as he was walking on the sidewalk at 8:21 a.m. on East 51st Street just east of Manor Road near Bruce Spruce Circle, police said. The Suburban left the road, hit a utility pole’s guide wire, spun sideways and hit Moss who died at the scene. This was Austin’s 40th traffic fatality of 2009.

The driver, who has not been arrested, fled on foot and faces charges of failure to stop and render aid.

Witnesses are asked to call the police vehicular homicide unit at (512) 974-4724.
