We offer you a free consultation. If you’ve been hurt, the last thing you need is to worry about paying legal bills when you’re already facing medical bills, lost wages, and having to deal with your car problems. If need be, we can come to you.

What is the purpose of the free initial consultation?

[You might wonder, why should I contact an attorney if I am in a car accident?](/contact-attorney-car-accident/)

The purpose of the free initial consultation is to:

* educate us about your problems (the facts) and needs (what solution you desire)
* allow us to determine if we would be a good match for you or your needs
* allow you to determine if we are firm you would like to work with

The purpose of the free initial consultation is not to provide free legal advice. The consultation **IS** covered by the [attorney-client privilege](http://www.attorney-austin.com/about/attorneyclientprivilege).

### What is covered at the free initial consultation?

Essentially, we will ask questions about your accident to determine if we can help you. We will spend enough time to determine if we can help you. After we have asked questions, we welcome your questions about your case, expectations, and about our firm. We generally do not give out legal advice during the free initial consultation because that is not its purpose. Once the free consultation has concluded, if we feel we can assist you, we will ask you to make a decision on whether you wish to hire us or not.

### How long will the free consultation last?

As long as it needs to. We do not limit you to a small time frame which only adds pressure to the consultation. Most consultations last as little as thirty minutes, but some have gone as long as two hours. Generally, we will allocate one hour, and if time is not available due to another appointment, we will reschedule and continue the consultation at a later date.
