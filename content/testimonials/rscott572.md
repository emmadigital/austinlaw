Great lawyer for personal injury claims Andrew represented me in a personal injury claim following a major car wreck. I was rear-ended by an under-insured driver, so it was complex in getting compensated by that driver’s insurance and then my own insurance. Andrew was thoughtful in dealing with me, and he helped me get the right medical care. He was bulldog determined and meticulous in dealing with the various insurance companies. He found the right balance of maximizing my recovery for damages and injuries but avoiding the pain of going to court. Who wants to sit through a trial!! Andrew recovered a highly satisfactory amount for my compensation, plus all my medical bills were paid, plus my car and property were fully replaced. I’m very happy to recommend him to my friends and to strangers (I hope you weren’t in an accident!). Richard
