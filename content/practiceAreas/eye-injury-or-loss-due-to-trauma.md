Eye injury is very common in case of road accidents involving cars, motorbikes and other such vehicles. Such injuries could result in the loss of vision for either of the eyes, or sometimes, even both eyes. Such accidents could also result in [permanent disfigurement](/practice-areas/serious-personal-injury/) or injuries that the victim has to carry for the remainder of their lives. Vision loss or blindness caused to a person due to road accidents must be treated with immediate medical assistance, and the person accused of causing the accident is liable to incur the expenses.

Loss of vision in one eye affects depth perception which in turn makes it harder to get around and to drive. Â Even worse, the remaining eye now becomes the difference between an impaired life and total blindness as there is no longer a “backup” eye.

## Eye injuries more than mere physical injuries

Eye injury or loss of vision due to trauma, which leads to partial or total blindness on one or both eyes can cause more than mere [physical pain](/pain-and-suffering/). The inability to see the world can be very agonizing, but the mental stress is far more. The victim has to live the rest of their lives without being able to use their eyes, and this can pose a large number of problems for them. Other related issues that can also cause a lot of mental stress include the [financial expenses of medical treatment](/practice-areas/no-health-insurance-no-problem/), inability to work efficiently causing [substantial loss of wages and income](/lost-wages-due-to-an-injury/), and other such financial damages. [Serious accident victims](/practice-areas/serious-personal-injury/) are entitled to receive monetary compensation from the responsible parties of the accident.

## Personal injury lawyers can help in obtaining appropriate financial compensations

In case of road accidents, where large expenses are involved, it can become very difficult to obtain the financial compensations from the responsible parties due to the numerous legal ramifications involved. In such scenarios, it becomes imperative to hire the services of a [personal injury lawyer](/meet-us/andrew-traub/) in order to obtain the proper monetary compensations. These lawyers have adequate knowledge and are well versed with the legal methods of extracting the appropriate amounts that can help the victims with their medical expenses as well as with their future lives. After all, the post traumatic stress from such accidents has a lot to do with the financial aspects of the victim during and after recovery from such accidents.

Personal injury lawyers can also help a great deal with obtaining sufficient financial compensation for vision loss cases that are incurred in road accidents. Other scenarios where people can lose their vision are accidents in construction sites, workplaces, and many other such places.

Without [proper insurance](/practice-areas/uninsured-and-underinsured-claims/), it can become very difficult for the victims to obtain adequate financial assistance necessary for the treatment as well as for setting up their lives afterwards. In some cases, even insurance companies do not tend to help the victims with their medical insurance, and an experienced personal injury lawyer can help in obtaining the insurance amounts.

Eye injury or loss of vision due to trauma can cause a lot of agony to the victims during and after the recovery process, and sufficient financial aid can reduce this stress significantly. Obtaining such financial assistance can often be difficult, but with the help of proper legal counseling, it can become easier for the victims to obtain their rightful compensations.
