An 18-wheeler struck and killed a pedestrian Tuesday morning on RM 620 near Quinlan Park Road.

The identity of the victim, who appeared to be about 30 years old, was not released, Travis County sheriff’s Capt. Art Cardenas said.

Witnesses told investigators they saw the man walking on the side of the road about 8 a.m., and the victim’s car was found parked nearby. It appears the man stepped into the roadway, where he was struck at highway speed by a westbound 18-wheeler, Cardenas said.

The truck driver stopped and notified authorities, he said, and no charges were filed in connection with the incident.
