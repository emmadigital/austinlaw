*Drunk driving accident lawyer* Andrew Traub says: *“A drunk driver’s insurance company may try to make sure your injury claim is as lengthy, complicated, and expensive for you as possible. They may use intimidation to try and convince you not to pursue your claim and to discourage you from seeking the advice of an experienced trial attorney. Insurance companies often deny responsibility, even in cases of clear liability and outrageous conduct while the injured party’s family faces a lifetime of pain, suffering and financial loss. Victims of a drunk driver’s negligence owe it to themselves and to society to hold the drunk driver responsible.”*

Experienced Drunk Driving Accident Lawyers

We are experienced in representing victims of drunk driving accidents and helping them recover financial compensation for the damages they have suffered. If the driver who caused the accident was legally drunk (had a blood alcohol content of .08 or more) we will pursue punitive damages in addition to compensation for your [pain and suffering](/faq/pain-and-suffering/), medical expenses, [lost wages](/lost-wages-due-to-an-injury/), and [property damage](/blog/handling-your-auto-property-damage-claim/).

Whether or not the drunk driver who injured you is punished through the criminal court, you have a right to financial compensation by filing a personal injury claim in civil court.

Drunk driving is the very definition of [negligence](/practice-areas/negligence/). Those who drink and drive knowingly put others at risk. We have seen the tragic results of the reckless decision to drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Drunk driving accidents can leave victims [permanently disabled](/practice-areas/serious-personal-injury/), paralyzed, [brain damaged](/practice-areas/brain-injury-lawyers/), or dead.

We aggressively pursue compensation on behalf of drunk driving accident victims. We will investigate to determine whether the drunk driver had any previous DWI charges. Did a bar or restaurant continue to serve alcohol to an obviously intoxicated patron who later caused an accident? Was the drunk driver’s employer aware that the driver was drunk? We will gather the facts, determine all sources of potential liability, and advocate on your behalf.
