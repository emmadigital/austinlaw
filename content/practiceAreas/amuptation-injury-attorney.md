Once a limb has been amputated, the victim needs to relearn basic skills such as walking, holding onto an object, and typing. Retraining or accommodation at work is usually required.

Because of the permanency of the injury, recovery can be slow and pain can last a lifetime. Even though the body part is gone, some people still feel pain, also known as “phantom limb.”

Equipment to replace the limb to walk or hold objects usually must be purchased. These parts wear out, so the cost and duration of the support device needs to be calculated before full and fair compensation can be determined.
