# Reckless Driving in Bad Weather

Winter has just started here in Texas just yet and it has been a rainy season. We are all so distracted while driving on a normal day with texting, adjusting the radio, checking to see who is singing the current song, dealing with screaming, hungry, or fighting children. I have even seen people in Austin reading a book, or putting on makeup while driving! This is all very dangerous behavior.

About 25% of all car crashes occur in bad weather, and most of those occur when the road is wet. Many drivers recognize that snow and ice can cause them to lose control of their cars, but most underestimate the dangers that rain can pose. For this reason, more people travel in wet weather, and do not realize the need to adjust to lower speeds when traveling on wet roads. Following cars less closely is also a strategy that provides drivers with more time to react if something dangerous occurs in their path.

**WHAT HAPPENS DURING A CRASH?** The laws of physics say that an object in motion will stay in motion, with the same speed and direction, unless it is acted upon by an outside force. So if you are traveling at 60 MPH and your car hits a solid wall and comes to an immediate stop, your body will continue going at 60 MPH until it is stopped by, say, a seat belt, airbag, or, at worst, a windshield. If the car has a rigid body, the rapid deceleration caused by the impact will produce injuries and fatalities. The force on the passengers is very high because the stopping time is only a split second.

According to [www.Weather.com](http://www.weather.com/), it is best not to drive in bad winter weather at all if it is avoidable. If you must drive, then be prepared for winter weather. After having a certified mechanic give your car a checkup, make sure you have an emergency kit prepared. An emergency kit should include, a cell phone or spare battery, jumper cables, a bag of sand or salt (even kitty litter can be used) for traction if you are stranded, blankets, extra gloves/mittens and hats, nonperishable foods such as nuts or protein bars and hard candy to keep your mouth moist in case you do not have any water, and a candle and matches in a waterproof container.

Once you have winterized your car and prepared for a disaster, you must practice safe driving. To be safe in bad weather, slow down, increase driving distance between you and the driver in front of you, turn on your headlights, avoid lane changes, when possible, approach intersections with caution, and keep windows clear.

Following these safety tips will hopefully prevent personal injuries and property damage to your vehicle.

Drive Safely!!!
