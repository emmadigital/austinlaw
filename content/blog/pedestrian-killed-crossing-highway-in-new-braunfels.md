A man died in New Braunfels on Wednesday morning after being hit by a pickup truck while walking across Texas 46.

Police say the crash happened in the 1100 block of the highway around 12:06 a.m.

The man, identified by police as 32-year-old Rudy Varela Jr. of New Braunfels, had been driving a Volkswagen Jetta when he lost control and hit a guardrail, disabling the car, police said.

According to authorities, Varela got out of the car and tried to walk across the highway when a passing Ford Ranger driven by a 42-year-old man slammed into him.

Emergency medical crews arrived within a few minutes and took Varela to the San Antonio Military Medical Center for treatment, but he died from his injuries.

The crash shut down traffic to one lane in each direction on the highway until 5:30 a.m.

Police said they do not expect to file any charges.
