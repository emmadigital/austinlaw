A Bastrop man was killed in a wreck Saturday on Texas 21, a Texas Department of Public Safety official said.

Bradley Goble was driving a 2006 Chrysler Town & Country in the eastbound lane of Texas 21 when the vehicle crossed the road and struck a westbound 2004 Ford pickup, the official said. The collision took place about 5:20 p.m. near FM 20.

Goble, 47, was taken to University Medical Center Brackenridge in Austin, where he later died. The pickup driver was not seriously injured.

Another person in Gobleâ€™s truck suffered a broken arm and other injuries that were not considered life-threatening.
