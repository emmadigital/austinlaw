A bicyclist was critically injured Monday morning in a crash on FM 620 at El Salido Parkway that left her pinned under an 18-wheeler.

The female cyclist was taken toga Round Rock hospital with a critical leg injury.

The woman and the 18-wheeler were at a stoplight in the southbound lanes of FM 620, facing the same direction. When the light turned green, the woman apparently veered right, and the 18-wheeler caught her bicycle and dragged her under a wheel.

“It was not a high-speed collision, but it was really traumatic because of the difference in the size, obviously,” said Warren Hassinger of the Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services. “At least one leg was badly crushed by the weight of the rig.”

He said the woman was undergoing surgery.
