For many years, we’veÂ worked hard to improve the lives of our clients after they’ve been devastatedÂ by the careless acts of others.

When a client doesn’t have health insurance, we’ve worked with doctors and funding companies to allow our clients to get the medical treatment they need and deserve so that they can make a quick recovery and get back to work, back to their lives.

Today, I’m happy to announce, that we’ve got another tool in our toolbox to help accident victims who don’t have health insurance:

TheÂ **free** pharmacy discount card. Â This card is honored at U.S. pharmacies everywhere (over 50,000 of them) on all FDA-approved prescriptions. Â The list of pharmacies that accept these cards includes Walgreens, Walmart, CVS, etc. Show the card to the pharmacist along with your prescription and ask for a discount on your medication and save up to 75% instantly!

It get’s even better.

We are making these free prescription discount cards available to the public. Â Anyone in Austin, Texas can [come by our office](/meet-us/directions/) and pick one up. Alternatively, we can mail one to you if you send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to 8701 Shoal Creek Blvd #401, Austin, Texas 78757. Be sure to include a note telling us to send you one of the free pharmacy discount cards in the return envelope.

Giving back to the community is important to us and we hope these cards will better the lives ofÂ those unable to afford health insurance and today’s sky-high prescription costs.
