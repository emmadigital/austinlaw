A mother and an infant were injured Friday morning when their car and an Austin school district bus carrying 26 students collided along Slaughter Lane, authorities said.

No, students were hospitalized, said Warren Has-singer, spokesman for Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services.

Police said the bus had a green light and was attempting to turn onto Texas Oaks Drive from Slaughter Lane but failed to yield to oncoming traffic. A KIA sedan slid into and under the bus, officials said.

Firefighters rescued the car’s driver, who was briefly pinned in.

She was taken to University Medical Center Brackenridge and was conscious, police said. The infant was taken to Dell Children’s Medical Center for observation.

No citations were issued, police said.

Officials said the driver has worked for the district since 2007. She has been placed on paid administrative leave until an investigation is complete, officials said.

She has not been involved in any other collisions during her time with the school district, officials said.
