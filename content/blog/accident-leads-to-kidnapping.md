Police arrested a man Wednesday who is accused of forcing a pregnant woman to-drive him away from the scene of an accident, according to an arrest affidavit.

The rollover collision happened about 12:20 p.m. Wednesday near the FM 969 and Blue\
Bluff Road. Kyle Jay Jones was the driver of the rolled-over vehicle and was seen by Travis County sheriff’s deputies leaving the scene in a car with an unidentified female driver, police say.

The woman, who is nine months pregnant, said she witnessed the accident. After the accident, Jones approached the woman and stuck an object which she believed to be a knife into her rib cage and demanded that she take him to a Texaco station on FM 69 and Delta Post, three miles from the accident.

When they reached the gas station, Jones left the woman’s car, threw a $20 bill at her and got into a white Chevrolet Trailblazer.

Jones, 23, is charged with aggravated kidnapping, a first-degree felony, and was in the Travis County Jail on Thursday, with bail set at $40,000.
