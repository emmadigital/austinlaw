**Improperly Maintained Cars**

Regular preventative maintenance will keep your car operating optimally and prolong its life. However, keeping up to date with maintenance is easier said than done. Here are some the top car maintenance mistakes owners typically make and how to avoid them.

**Ignoring the Check Engine Light**

The **Check Engine Light** is your vehicle computerâ€™s way of telling you that there might be a problem and that you should have your car services as soon as possible.

Occasionally your carâ€™s **Check Engine Light** comes on even though there does not seem to be any signs of trouble. Most of us have the tendency to continue driving without having it checked. Driving with a possible engine problem can quickly lead to a larger and more expensive issue down the road. If your **Check Engine Light** comes on, you should go and have it checked as soon as possible to save money in the long run.

**Driving with an Overheating Engine**

A carâ€™s engine gets very hot while it is running, so it has a cooling system to avoid overheating. If the cooling system fails, then the engine begins overheating. If it begins to overheat, you must stop and turn off the car immediately, and call a tow company. Driving with an overheating engine can lead to more extensive and expensive repairs.

**Not Checking Tire Pressure**

It is nearly impossible to gauge your carâ€™s tire pressure just from looking at the tire. Air pressure may still be high or low even when tires appear to be properly inflated. Many factors such as weather and debris can change the pressure of the tires. Your car is less safe by being more prone to blowouts. The fuel economy is also decreased if you have improperly inflated tires.

**Not Rotating Tires/Neglecting to get a wheel alignment**

Misaligned or unrotated tires can cause issues such as uneven treadwear and an increased risk for a flat tire. A good rule of thumb is to have your tires rotated at each oil change.

**Skipping Oil Changes**

Motor oil needs to be changed with some regularity because old oil will break down leading to sludge deposits in your engine, which can damage the engine. Check your carâ€™s manual to see how often the manufacturer recommends and an oil change.

**Neglecting Fluid Checks**

Motor oil is not the only fluid in the car that needs to be checked or changed. The other fluids in your car are brake fluid, transmission fluid, engine coolant, and power steering fluid. Check your ownerâ€™s manual to see what the recommended time frame for your fluid checks should be. This will keep your vehicle running smoothly without any leaks.

**Not inspecting the breaks**

This goes without saying, if you hear any squeaking or grinding noises when you break, then have your breaks checked out immediately to prevent any accidents.

In addition to regular oil and fluid changes, donâ€™t forget to get your car serviced every 30,000, 60,000, and 90,000 miles and then every 30,000 miles thereafter.

This will insure that you car is maintained properly and keeps you and your loved ones safe.
