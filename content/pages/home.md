      slidertext: With larger firms, you never or rarely get to speak to your lawyer.
        If being able to speak to the person in charge of your case isn’t
        important, then don’t worry about this section. Our clients generally
        like to speak to the person with the knowledge of the law and how it
        applies to their case. They want to know that their calls will be
        promptly returned and their emails answered.

    - sliderheading: Experience
      slidertext: When it comes to the law, experience counts. You’ll want to choose a
        lawyer who focuses on the area of law you need help in. A great divorce
        lawyer does not make a great negligence or accident lawyer. Make sure
        the lawyer you hire has lots of experience with your type of injury,
        injury cause, or preferably both. Andrew has worked exclusively on
        injury claims since 2007.

    - sliderheading: Trial Results
      slidertext: Some lawyers never see the inside of a courtroom or do so only once
        or twice in their career. Be sure to ask your lawyer both when was the
        last time he tried a case and what was the result. If he hasn’t tried a
        case in a few years, beware. Insurance companies know who takes cases to
        trial and who doesn’t. Assume the worst – that the insurance company
        will deny, delay, and offer you pennies of your claim’s value and force
        you to go to trial to get justice. If the insurance company knows your
        lawyer won’t go to trial, how do you think that affects their valuation
        of your case? Our firm has obtained a top 100 verdict in all of Texas
        two years in a row (for all trials, not just personal injury)!

    - sliderheading: Settlement Results
      slidertext: Don’t be fooled by high settlement results. If I told you I settled
        a case for $1,000,000 that might sound great, but what if the case was
        worth $2,000,000? Settlement results by themselves are meaningless. You
        need to know if liability was admitted or fought, where there any
        factors that made this case stand out (like a drunk driver), what were
        the injuries, how painful were they, how long did they last, and how did
        they interfere with that persons life. Of course, the amount of
        available insurance is also important and usually limits the amount that
        can be recovered. But sometime, an experienced lawyer will recover more
        than the policy limits for their client. We’ve done that many times with
        ultimate resolution for our clients being anywhere from 5 times the
        policy limit to 40 times the policy limit.

    - sliderheading: Reputation
      slidertext: All of the items above play into a lawyers reputation – experience,
        settlement results, and trial results, as well as opinions from clients
        and other attorneys affect the lawyers reputation. A lawyer with a good
        reputation will generally be better to work with than one who does not
        have a good reputation. Check out your potential lawyer’s reputation
        online before you hire him or her.

        interaction with you. Your case will not be settled for less than it is

  - title: Do I Need A Lawyer ?
    content: >-
      The first step is research. You may be able to reach a settlement on your
      own as long as your medical treatment was minimal and it was 100% clear
      who was at fault. But a more complex personal injury means you likely need
      the help of an attorney to add value to your case.


      In some scenarios, you may need a lawyer if you don’t have health insurance, your injuries are severe or won’t go away, you have a head injury, you have a broken bone or fracture, a fatality was involved. Your insurance company may not admit liability, and you may have missed days of work and lost money you depend on to feed your family.


      These are just a few instances when you would need the advice of an attorney. If you’re still unsure, contact Traub Law Offices and one of our attorneys will help you determine what comes next.
    contentheading: The answer isn’t always “yes”
  - content: >-
      Someone approaching you on behalf of another lawyer soliciting services
      after a car wreck or accident is called a “runner.” This is an unethical
      tactic outlawed in Texas, a state prohibiting lawyers from contacting you
      first. You must initiate contact with a lawyer.


      Some of our clients were approached by runners at the hospital or home shortly after an accident. Most people in these situations are still agitated or recovering, too distracted to make rational decisions. This is why insurance adjusters take your statements and get releases from you right away.


      Lawyers willing to break the law with runners may not be your best legal representatives. We offer a free consumer guide to answer your questions about personal injury claims. You also may contact Traub Law Offices online for the answers you need.
    title: What about non-attorney's helping?
    contentheading: This is an illegal tactic in Texas
  - content: >-
      There are juries that have not found defendants in personal injuries cases
      liable, even when they hit someone from behind.


      We research your claim and combine it with our experience to provide an approximation. Our analysis is based on your injury claim details, and we use past settlements or verdicts as starting points to estimate a reasonable amount. Each case is different, and we’ve secured large settlements for clients with small medical bills, but we needed to fight hard for those with large bills that insurance companies did not want to pay.


      Any lawyer who guarantees a specific settlement amount should not be trusted. Your best bet is contacting a personal injury attorney who will estimate the value and assist you in reaching a fair settlement. Andrew Traub fights to help victims in Texas settle their claims. Contact the Traub Law Offices on this page or by calling.
    title: What is my case worth?
    contentheading: There are no promises when it comes to lawsuits
  - content: >-
      You may feel your pending personal injury claim is not receiving the
      attention it needs, be it a lack of communication on the part of the
      lawyer or something just not feeling right. In most cases, clients with
      these attorneys have not educated themselves enough to understand what a
      good Texas personal injury lawyer is.


      Firing your lawyer can be difficult once you have signed an agreement and they have put work into your case. This is why it’s important to research what make a quality lawyer and find the best for your Texas personal injury case.


      Traub Law Offices has taken several cases in which clients were not satisfied with the prior lawyer for varying reasons. Before we can assume representation of your case, we would need to see the agreement you signed with the previous lawyer before we can help.

subtitle: "## How to Choose Your Austin Accident Lawyer"

# Experienced Texas Injury Lawyers

A car, truck, motorcycle or bicycle crash changes your life. The means to support your family through adequate means of transportation and employment could be put in jeopardy. It could mean steep medical bills attached to life-long injuries. Worst of all, insurance companies may refuse the compensation promised by a policy or may refuse it altogether. It leaves you frustrated and angry, but some people accept these difficult circumstances as their new normal.

The negligence of others leads to most accidents. A dog is an animal, and its bite can be severe and indiscriminate. It is up to pet owners to control them and prevent unprovoked attacks against other people.

These destructive bites could happen at any time. Austin experienced near record numbers of dog bite reports in 2015.

# We can help reclaim your life.

Traub Law Office assists people who have been placed in these situations by no fault of their own. The negligence of others, such as careless dog owners and distracted drivers, are liable and must accept the accidents.

Austin personal injury lawyer Andrew Traub has helped Texans put their lives back on track by dealing with stingy insurance companies and negligent businesses and individuals who have caused harm to others. We provide a free book for those injured to understand their rights, and, if your case qualifies, we work to help you recover the compensation you deserve.
