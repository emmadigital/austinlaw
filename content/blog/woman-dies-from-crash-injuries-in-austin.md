Austin police said Tuesday that a 49-year-old woman involved in a wreck in Northwest Austin on December 7th died from her injuries Friday.

The wreck occurred in the 9300 block of RM 2222. Police said Estelle Edelman was stopped in the eastbound inside lane when her 1996 Toyota Corolla was rear ended by a 2001 Dodge Ram. Her car was pushed into oncoming traffic, police said, and her car was struck head-on by an 18- wheeler traveling west. Several more cars were involved, but no one else was seriously injured, police said.

Edelman was taken to University Medical Center Brackenridge, where she died Friday, police said.

Police are asking any witnesses to call vehicular homicide detectives at 974-4761.
