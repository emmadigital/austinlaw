A man was killed and three others were injured in a head-on collision on Monday on Texas 195 about a half mile north of Florence, said Tom Vinger, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety.

Rodrigo Enriquez, 47, of Killeen died in the 5:30 a.m. crash on the two-lane road, Vinger said.

Louis Hirsh, a 21-year-old soldier from Hutton, was driving a Honda Accord north on Texas 195 when it crossed the center line and hit the Chevrolet Prism that Enriquez was driving.

Hirsch was injured in the crash as were Enriquezâ€™s passengers Vladimiro Alvarado, 46, and Junior Alvarado, 23.
