A man was killed and two others injured in a wreck late Saturday that occurred on General Williamson Drive in northwest Travis County, according to the sheriff’s office.

Jose Raul Guillen-Ortiz, a 29-year-old passenger, was not wearing a seat belt. He died at the scene.

A dispatcher with the Travis County sheriff’s office said that about 10:57 p.m., a 1998 Ford Explorer was driving on General Williamson Drive near RM 620 and left the roadway for unknown reasons.

The vehicle struck several concrete blocks and went airborne before striking a utility pole, the dispatcher said.

The driver and another passenger were taken to University Medical Center Brackenridge with injuries that were not life threatening.
