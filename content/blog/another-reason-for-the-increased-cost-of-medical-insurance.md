A McAllen cardiologist who sent medical assistants and untrained employees around South Texas in a recreational vehicle to offer “free” diagnoses and treatment – only to later bill the federal government – has pleaded guilty to health care fraud.

Dr. Fabian Aurignac billed the federal Medicaid and Medicare programs thousands of dollars for services unlicensed workers performed, according to the U.S. attorney’s office.

Aurignac, 46, used the Medicare and Midicaid numbers of the people his RV crew found to bill the government for services thatwere never performed, performed by unlicensed personnel, or performed unnecessarily, according to the indictment.

Aurignac admitted guilt as part of a plea agreement and faces up to 10 years in prison.
