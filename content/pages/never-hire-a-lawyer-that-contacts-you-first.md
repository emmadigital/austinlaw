There are some lawyers in Texas who obtain clients by sending a “runner” to push their services on you after your car wreck.Â For these personal injury cases, especially when you’ve been in a [serious automobile accident](/practice-areas/serious-personal-injury/ "Austin Serious Personal Injury Attorney"), the last thing you want or need is someone trying to sell you something. Many people can’t make proper decisions while they are still agitated or recovering from a wreck (which is why insurance adjusters like to take your statement and get releases from you right away).

After talking to many clients who were approached at the hospital or their home shortly after a car wreck by an someone, usually not a lawyer, and somebody who they didn’t know who told them “Oh, I know you’ve been hurt.Â You should sign up with this personal injury lawyer right away.”

Well, this is highly unethical and illegal in Texas.Â If you think about it, if the lawyer who wants to represent you has to hire somebody to chase you down at the hospital after you’ve been in a car wreck, how good can that lawyer be?Â What quality of service can he provide?

Bottom line, if your in an automobile accident in Texas and you are approached by anyone representing a personal injury lawyer, you should contact the Texas State Bar and file a complaint.Â Why?Â This is extremely unethical in Texas and it is also illegal.Â In fact, the rules of ethics even prohibit a lawyer contacting you first.Â So, a lawyer can’t contact you even if your friend used him at some time in the past and then your friend heard about your accident and called the lawyer he used to let him know about your accident – that lawyer still can’t call you – you have to call him first.

I guarantee you that lawyers who have to send people to hospitals to sign up clients aren’t great lawyers, and lawyers that contact you before your or your spouse contacts them are usually desperate.Â Why would they have to send their “goons” your way when you’re in a weakened state? They’re basically trying to prey on you!
