I have been around lawyers all my life. My father was a lawyer before his death. Andrew Traub is a very trusted lawyer that you can trust and believe will take care of you completely. Mr Traub is a Professional Lawyer that i highly recommend. He is very knowledgeable of the law and can communicate technical legal concepts in terms that you can understand.
