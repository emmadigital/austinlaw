A man died Monday afternoon in Williamson County after a vehicle crossed into incoming traffic and collided with a pickup in which he was riding, a Texas Department of Public Safety official said.

Eric Aguillar, 42, of Austin, a passenger in Raymond Dale Griffith’s pickup died at the scene when Douglas Fabian Tarrance, 20, of Killeen tried to pass a northbound tractor-trailer that had stopped to turn left.

Tarrance drove into oncoming traffic and hit Griffith’s pickup truck.

Griffith was treated for injuries that were not life-threatening while Tarrance was taken to Scott and White Memorial Hospital in Temple in critical condition.

Both Tarrance and Aguillar were not wearing their seat belts. A sad lesson in the importance of buckling up.
