A woman and her grandson died in a wreck Friday night, authorities said.

Taylor police responded to the crash about 8:30 p.m. in the 1100 block of South main Street. Authorities said Pflugerville resident Glenda Louise Werth, 59, was driving a 2009 Honda van north on South Main Street with 20 month old, Hunter Werth, as a passenger when she stopped and began backing up.

Lexington resident, Madison Plinkington, 23, was also traveling north in a 2008 Toyota SUV and struck the Honda van from behind, causing it to enter the southbound lane, authorities said. The vehicle was struck head on by a 2006 Chevrolet truck driven by Taylor resident, Abel Estrada Macias, 22.

Glenda Worth was pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said. The child was taken to Dell Children’s Medical Center, where he was later pronounced dead. The father of the boy, David Werth, said in a social media post that Glenda Werth was the child’s grandmother.

Estrada-Macias was taken to Seton Medical Center Williamson with injuries that were not life threatening, and Plinkington was uninjured, authorities said.

This is the third fatal wreck in Taylor this year, authorities said.
