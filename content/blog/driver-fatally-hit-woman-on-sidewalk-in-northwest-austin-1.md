A man has been charged with intoxication manslaughter after Austin police say he [fatally struck a woman on a sidewalk](/practice-areas/wrongful-death-attorney/) with his car last week.

On May 21, 27-year-old Gary Joseph Brauneis was driving a gray 2010 Mazda M3i on the northbound service road of U.S. 183 near the intersection with Pond Springs Road, just south of Texas 45, around 10:36 p.m.

The Mazda hit the back of a white 2014 GMC pickup truck that was sitting at a red light on Pond Springs Road, pushing the truck into the intersection, police said.

The Mazda continued to move north, and drove up onto a sidewalk, [hitting a pedestrian](/practice-areas/pedestrian-accident-lawyers/), 30-year-old Ginger Mattox, police said. The Mazda then crashed into a nearby building.

Mattox was taken to St. David’s Round Rock Medical Center where she died, police said. The driver of the GMC truck was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not expected to be life-threatening.

Brauneis was arrested and charged with [driving while intoxicated](/practice-areas/drunk-driving-accident-lawyer/) and intoxication manslaughter, police said. He was booked into the Williamson County Jail because the crash happened in a part of Austin that’s inside Williamson County.

Anyone with information on the crash can call police investigators at 512-974-8544. Tipsters also can use the Austin PD app.

Mattox is the 36th person to die in Austin traffic so far this year, police said.
