Oscar Barbosa, 51, of Williamson County was sentenced to 33 years in prison after pleading guilty to his sixth driving-while-intoxicated conviction on Monday.

He had been arrested in September because he was weaving on U.S. 183 in Liberty Hill, according to Williamson County District Attorney John Bradley. A breath test found that Mr. Barbosa had more than two times the legal limit of alcohol for driving in his system.
