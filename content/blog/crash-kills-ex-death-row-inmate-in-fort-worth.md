A death row inmate freed after an appeals court overturned his capital murder conviction has died in an East Texas pickup wreck.

Michael Roy Toney, 43, died at 11 a.m. Saturday in Cherokee County when his truck veered off FM 347 and overturned. He was ejected and crushed, the Department of Public Safety said.

Toney had spent nearly 10 years on death row in the 1985 bombing deaths of three people in a Lake Worth trailer. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled in December that the prosecutor withheld evidence that might have helped Toney at his 1999 trial.
