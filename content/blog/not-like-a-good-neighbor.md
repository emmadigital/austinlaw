Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood said that his office has settled its dispute with State Farm Insurance Cos. over how the insurer handled Hurricane Katrina damage claims in Mississippi. State Farm has complied with a 2007 agreement by reopening some claims and agreeing to pay more than $74 million more to policyholders whose homes were damages or destroyed.

Sad that the attorney general has to step in to make them perform.
