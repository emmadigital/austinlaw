One man died and three people were injured after a head-on collision near Kyle, Texas early Monday morning.

The man, 31-year-old Jose Hernandez was driving north in a southbound lane on Interstate 35. A 2007 Jeep Compass driven by Jeffery Hill, 25, was headed south and hit Hernandez’s car head-on at about midnight.

Hernandez was pronounced dead at the scene. Hill and two passengers, both women in their 20s, were taken to University Medical Center at Brackenridge and were listed in stable condition.
