A 19-year-old Marble Falls man who was hospitalized Thursday after a wreck involving a school bus in Burnet County died Friday, a hospital official said.

Mark Fluty was severely injured Thursday when the 1998 Chevrolet Cavalier he was riding in left the eastbound lanes of FM 1431 and crossed into oncoming traffic, colliding with a Marble Falls school district bus.

Fluty and the driver of the car, Mark Cooksey, who is in his 20s, were flown to University Medical Center Brackenridge. Cooksey was released that evening.\
The school bus driver and the seven students on the bus, which was traveling from Marble Falls Elementary School, were not injured, said Ryder Warren, school district superintendant.

The collision occurred on FM 1431 near the entrance of Honeymoon Ranch Road at 3:55 p.m. Thursday. The accident remains under investigation by Granite Shoals police.
