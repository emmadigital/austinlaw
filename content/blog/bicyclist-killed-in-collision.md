A man is dead after being struck by a car while riding his bicycle early Sunday.

Police Lt. Darrell Boydston said the man, whose name and age have not been released, was struck in the 1900 block of East Texas 71 near Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.

Boydston said no one was charged in the collision.

A City of Austin ordinance requiring car drivers to give cyclists a 3-foot berth when passing (for truck drivers the buffer is 6 feet) takes effect today.
