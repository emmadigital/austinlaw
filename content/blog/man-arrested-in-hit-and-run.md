Austin police have charged David Delacerda, 30, who is accused of [hitting a construction worker last week and leaving the scene](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/blog/worker-killed-in-i-35-hit-and-run/), according to an arrest affidavit. The worker died.

Delacerda was arrested after he was released from Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio.

The wreck happened about 1:30 a.m. in the 11400 block of southbound I-35, police said. Police said a dark-color sport utility vehicle ran through a marked construction zone near Onion Creek Parkway and hit the worker, identified as Fontino Cortes-Cruz, 36.

Cortes-Cruz was part of a crew that was repaving the interstate and had been laying reflective tabs on the highway when he was hit, according to the Texas Department of Transportation.

Hays County sheriffâ€™s deputies found a burned SUV outside of Kyle about 4 a.m. Austin police said, and shortly afterward, police received a call from South Austin Hospital that a man with burns on his body had checked into the hospital.

Delacerda, who was released from the burn center on Friday, is charged with felony failure to stop and render aid, which carries a maximum of 10 years in prison upon conviction.

He is in Bexar County Jail with bail set at $100,000.
