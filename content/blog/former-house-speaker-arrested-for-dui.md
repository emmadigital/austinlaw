Former Texas House Speaker Gibson Lewis, 72, was arrested last Thursday night on charges of drunken driving, Austin police said.

Lewis was driving west on Fourth Street, at the intersection with Lavaca Street, in the turn-only lane about 11 p.m. when a mounted officer saw him continue straight on Fourth Street instead of turning, an arrest affidavit said.

The officer then stopped Lewis and called for backup, the affidavit said. Lewis had a blood-alcohol level of 0.16, Austin police said.

Lewis was elected speaker of the House five times and was active in the Legislature for more than 20 years, retiring in 1993 after pleading no contest in 1992 to tow misdemeanor charges alleging he failed to report some stock holdings on hi 1988 and 1989 disclosure statements.
