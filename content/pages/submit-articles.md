**Contribute bylined articles for AustinAccidentLawyer.com**

Bylined articles (of **at least 1,000 words**) written from an objective viewpoint and conveying valuable how-to content (practical advice, tips, and know-how) or information in a fresh, approachable voice are more likely to meet our standardsâ€”and therefore more likely to be accepted for publication.

We will inform you if your article has been accepted for publication; expect to hear from us at the latest within a week of our having received your email. If we choose not to accept your article, you may or may not hear from us, depending on how crowded our inbox is.

Articles accepted for publication will be edited for clarity and brevity and to conform to the AustinAccidentLawyer.com style. We will likely change your title, too, so you might want to suggest some alternatives.

So, if you are interested in contributing articlesâ€”on a one-time or a regular basisâ€”here are some guidelines:

1. Articles should be original to the author and **unpublished elsewhere**.Â No spun content.
2. Don’t submit an article on a topic that has been beaten to death unless you have a unique slant.
3. Articles should offer readers **clear information, advice, takeaways, and how-to tips** about a specific [personal injury](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/personal-injury-services/serious-personal-injury/ "Austin Serious Personal Injury Attorney") topic (things like car accidents, motorcycle accidents, truck accidents, dog bites, product defects, medical malpractice, injuries, keeping safe as it relates to one of those, etc). Bullet points are good. Meandering text is not.
4. At the beginning of your article, **list two or three bullet points summarizing its key takeaways**â€”the lessons learned and the how-tos contained in the article. They will be published along with the article.
5. Include a **brief bio** of at most 25 words and a recent **headshot** (make sure your entire head is in the picture).
6. Include relevant **links in parentheses**, next to the words to be linked (i.e., do not embed the links).Â There must be a **minimum of 4 links to resources which you rely on that are not your own site.**
7. Articles must be at least 1,000 words with no fluff.
8. Make sure there are no spelling or grammar errors.
9. Submit **articles in Word format** (no PDF files, please), as email attachments.
10. The byline at the top of the article will include your picture, name, links to several social media accounts, and the copy may contain one link to your website or blog.
11. If you submit an article that mentions businesses or companies in which you have a vested interest, **disclose** as much to the audience.
12. AustinAccidentLawyer.com get the copyright, and may reprint your piece, with full attribution, in AustinAccidentLawyer.com’s products, including marketing materials.Â In other words, we own the content so that it is not spun and redistributed.
13. We do not pay guest contributors for their occasional articles.
14. We do not publish press releases.
15. Replying to comments on your articles is a good way to ensure that we continue to publish your articles.
