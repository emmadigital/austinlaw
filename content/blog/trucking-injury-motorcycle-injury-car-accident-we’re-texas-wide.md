If you are looking for a [trucking accidents lawyer in Austin, TX](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/practice-areas/truck-accident-lawyer/) you have come to the right place. The Traub Law Office has provided skilled personal injury representation to clients in the Austin area since 2003. We handle a wide variety of personal injury and [wrongful death matters](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/practice-areas/wrongful-death-attorney/), including cases involving [vehicle accidents](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/practice-areas/car-accident-lawyers/), [dog bites](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/practice-areas/dog-bite-injury-lawyer/), and [slip and fall injuries](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/practice-areas/slip-and-fall-injury-lawyers/). We take great pride in the thoroughness with which we prepare accident injury cases. Our attorneys and associates all contribute to our successful record of obtaining compensation for injured persons.

We develop a personal relationship with each client and his or her family. We believe strongly in the importance of ongoing and frequent communication with clients, and update clients personally after every new development. We often visit clients at home or in the hospital to see how their recovery is progressing. We work with creditors to delay collection proceedings when clients face severe financial problems because their injuries forced them to stop working. We have even helped clients obtain short-term loans for their treatment until we recover compensation for them. Our goal is to remove the financial pressure from injured clients, allowing them to focus on recovering their health.Â We help clients throughout Texas.

We offer a [free initial consultation](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/meet-us/free-consultation/), and all cases are handled on a [contingency fee basis](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/no-fees-if-no-recovery/), meaning you do not owe us any attorney’s fees unless and until we successfully recover on your behalf. Weekend and evening consultations are available by appointment, and services are also available for Spanish speaking clients. For a personal injury lawyer who assists with the entire case, not just the legal paperwork, contact the Traub Law Office.

Call 512-246-9191 today.
