A tractor-trailer slammed into backed-up traffic on Interstate 35 near the Texas-Oklahoma border on Monday, killing three people.

The wreck occurred on a section of I-35 where two lanes narrow to one because of work being done on a bridge, about two miles southwest of Gainesville and about thirteen miles south of the border with Oklahoma.

The 18-wheeler, being driven by James Crayton, 59, of Dallas apparently never slowed down before slamming into the rear car of the jam.
