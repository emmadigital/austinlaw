Austin police are investigating the death of a man who was hit by a vehicle after he got out of his car to inspect damage from a wreck Friday night.

Just after 10 p.m., Jose Angel Fuentes-Reyes, 28, was stopped at a traffic light at Manor Road and Airport Boulevard when his pickup was rear-ended by a Chevrolet Tahoe, police said. When Fuentes-Reyes got out of his truck, the Tahoe driver backed up and drove forward to leave the scene, police said.

The Tahoe hit Fuentes-Reyes as he tried to stop it, police said. He was taken to University Medical Center at Brackenridge where he died Saturday, police said.

Anyone with information is asked to call police at (512) 974-8212.
