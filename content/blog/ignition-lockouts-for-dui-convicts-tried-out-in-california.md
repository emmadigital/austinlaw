Sacrament California will test requiring that drivers convicted of drunken driving install devices that block vehicles from starting if alcohol is detected on the drivers’ breath. The bill requires installing an ignition interlock device on every vehicle owned or operated by a first-time DUI offender in four counties: Alameda, Los Angeles, Sacramento and Tulare. The law expires in 2016.

My question is why hasn’t this been done before?
