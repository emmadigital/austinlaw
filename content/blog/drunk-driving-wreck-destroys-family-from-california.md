On Saturday afternoon, a family of four traveling to the airport to go back home was [hit by a drunk driver](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/practice-areas/drunk-driving-accident-lawyer/). It’s possible that only one of them may survive; the 10-year-old girl who was sitting in the backseat.

The Latulippe family, from California, flew to Austin to visit friends, said Jim Enos. Enos’ 38-year-old daughter and 14-year-old grandson were [killed in the crash](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/practice-areas/wrongful-death-attorney/). When the crash occured, the family was on the way to the airport to return home.

Guy Brasted, 41, is facing two counts of intoxication manslaughter in the crash. Brasted was driving a Jeep north on Research Boulevard. Brasted lost control, crossed a highway-dividing cable into the southbound lanes and collided head-on with a Fiat. Riding in the Fiat was the Latulippe family. The crash happened about 3:30 p.m., just west of MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1).

Nancy Latulippe, 38, and her son, 14-year-old Jackson Latulippe, died at the scene, according to police. EMS rushed 41-year-old Scott Latulippe, the father, to Dell Seton Medical Center. Latulippe suffered [traumatic brain damage ](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/practice-areas/brain-injury-lawyers/)and is not expected to survive, Enos said. The family is from Valley Center, Calif.

Brasted, whose blood alcohol content was 0.203, was also injured in the crash, his arrest affidavit says. Police are holding Brasted in Travis County Jail with bail set at $200,000.Â Brasted is currently facing an intoxication assault charge for Scottâ€™s injuries, in addition to the two other manslaughter charges. If Scott Latulippe dies from his injuries, Brasted will likely also be charged with a third count of intoxication manslaughter, Enos said.

Records show Brasted had been a Marine assigned to Camp Pendleton in the late 1990s near Oceanside, Calif. â€” less than 20 miles from the Latulippesâ€™ hometown of Valley Center in San Diego County. According to his LinkedIn profile, Brasted recently worked as a trucker in New Mexico. Until this crash in Austin, Brasted had no record of drunken driving or any other felony.

Kiera Latulippe, 10, is now out of the hospital, Enos said. Her grandmother is currently with her in Austin, and they plan to return home later this week.

â€œShe had very little physical damage, but she did see everything that happened,â€ Enos said.

Enos said the crash illustrates the horrifying [dangers of drunken driving.](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/blog/avoiding-drunk-driver-accidents/)

â€œRational people say, â€˜If Iâ€™m impaired, I can call Uber or Lyft,â€™ but when people are drunk, theyâ€™re irrational. They believe theyâ€™re bulletproof, and they put everybody in danger. (Brasted) wiped out one of the finest families,â€ Enos told the Austin Statesman.

Scott Latulippe is a video and digital media teacher. He teaches driverâ€™s education at Valley Center High School, where Jackson Latulippe was a freshman, Enos said. Nancy Latulippe had returned to work as a supervisor at GEICO Insurance Co. after spending several years as a stay-at-home mom.

The Valley Center Community Aid Group is accepting donations for the family, which Enos said will help him and his wife take care of Kiera.

**Those who would like to contribute can make checks payable to VCCAG, designated for the Latulippe Family, and mail to VCCAG, P.O. Box 962, Valley Center, CA 92082.**

Our condolences go out to Kiera Latulippe and the Enos family.
