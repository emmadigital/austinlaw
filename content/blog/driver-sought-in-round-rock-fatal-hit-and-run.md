Round Rock police are asking for the public’s help in finding the driver of a car that hit and fatally wounded a motorcyclist last week.

The wreck occurred on September 25 at about 9:45 p.m. when the driver of a white Chevrolet Impala failed to yield the right of way while turning left in the 1700 block of North Mays Street. Victor Luna was riding a Harley-Davidson, which hit the car’s right rear side when the car crossed his lane. Mr. Luna, who was not wearing a helmet, was tossed over the car and landed on his head. He was taken to University Medical Center at Brackenridge in Austin and died Sunday from his injuries.

Witnesses said that somehow the motorcycle ended up stuck to the front of the car, causing the driver of the Impala to swerve erratically to release it. The driver, who faces manslaughter charges, then took off down Boman Road at a high rate of speed.

The police are asking the public to consider whether such a vehicle may be known to them to frequent a particular area, but has been absent since Thursday’s incident; possibly garaged, covered, or otherwise concealed.

Anybody with information is asked to call the Round Rock Police Department at (512) 218-5500.
