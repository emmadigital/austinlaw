According to the FDA, Reglan (generic name of Metoclopramide), which is used to treat acid reflux, has been linked to a condition called tardive diskinesia which **causes involuntary movements of the mouth (tongue and lip smacking), face, neck and sometimes the arms, trunk, or legs.** It can also cause Parkinsonâ€™s-like symptoms, Dystonia, Akathisia, Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome and other involuntary muscular reactions. Children and the elderly appear to be the most susceptible. **There is no known treatment.**

If you have been using Reglan or its generic equivalent for more than 12 weeks and are suffering from any of these serious side effects, call The Traub Law Office at (512) 343-2572.
