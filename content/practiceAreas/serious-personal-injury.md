If you or a loved one will be permanently disabled from an accident, strong legal advocacy from an Austin serious personal injury attorney is more important than ever. While no amount of money can restore your health and make up for your injuries, you need enough compensation to cover your future medical care, lost earnings, and lost capacity to earn.

Unfortunately, you face potential exploitation at every turn. Insurance companies, medical providers, and even other personal injury lawyers may try to take advantage of you.

Don’t let it happen. Call us at (512) 246-9191 (or [request our free consumer reports](/free-accident-books/)) and let us tell you about your rights and the pitfalls that you face in pursuing your personal injury claim.

We’re proud that we not only have a strong record of satisfied clients, but we also have a strong record of helping injured victims even when other lawyers have failed them.

## Will the insurance company treat me fairly?

A decade ago, insurance adjusters and personal injury lawyers were often able to work together to come up with fair values to resolve claims. That’s history. Today, the insurance companies have made strategic decisions to try to maximize their profits by minimizing what they pay personal injury victims. Insurance adjusters are well trained, and they know their job is to pay an injured person as little as possible. They’ll use any advantage they can get even misusing innocent mistakes to minimize their payouts.

Accident victims are sometimes shocked by how far insurance companies will go. For example, a couple of years ago, a couple made a claim against Progressive Insurance, their own insurance company. To minimize what it had to pay, Progressive hired a private investigator couple to join the victims church and talk their way into the victims private support sessions. That way, the investigators would have access to the victims most confidential thoughts and information. While this situation was extreme, it does show the mindset of many insurance adjusters.

The most common tactic of the insurance company is the “swoop and settle” tactic employed by some insurance companies who come in and settle claims early before the injured persons know the true extent of their injuries and the nature of their rights. In many cases, the insurance adjusters not only fail to explain the nature of the settlements, but they often make out-right misrepresentations about the injured person’s ability to bring future claims.

## Should I hire a lawyer I see on TV?

At the same time, injury victims are seeing increasing threats from unethical lawyers and medical providers. The last few years have seen a rise of undercover stories and lawsuits about lawyers, sometimes working through chiropractors, illegally soliciting personal injury clients.

We have also seen a rise in lawyers (often those who advertise on TV or in the Yellow Pages) who want to run a volume practice. They may try to represent as many clients as possible, and settle claims as early as possible even when it isn’t in the client’s best interest. If it becomes obvious that they cannot easily settle the claims, these lawyers will often fire the clients or dump them on another attorney not in their practice – so you don’t end up with the attorney you thought you were hiring. Do you think a client gets maximum value for a claim when insurance companies know the attorney isn’t willing to pursue the client’s case through litigation?

And on top of that, tort reform has made juries skeptical. It used to be you could go to court, show them how you were injured and how much work you missed and get compensation for that. Not any more. Now the jurors start out thinking you’re out to cheat the system.

## How do I choose a lawyer?

So what can you do? How is a person supposed to focus on healing and getting back on his or her feet while battling insurance adjusters and worrying about avoiding problem lawyers and medical providers?

We think the best way for serious personal injury victims to protect themselves from becoming victims for a second time is to arm themselves with information like our [free accident guides](/resources/guides/). If you’re ready to talk to a lawyer about a potential claim then call us at (512) 246-9191.

But we know that some injury victims don’t always want to talk to an attorney (or they have an attorney that they don’t trust). And that’s why we are giving accident victims our free book “[The Seven Deadly Sins that Can Wreck Your Accident Claim in Texas.](/resources/free-texas-accident-report/)”

This book isn’t designed to be a legal book for lawyers. Instead, the book is a consumer guide with easy-to-read information that sets out some of the mistakes that accident victims make and provides advice on how you might avoid these mistakes. The advice deals with everything from how to avoid hiring a lawyer when you don’t need one to hiring the right lawyer, from dealing with doctors to dealing with insurance adjusters. If you or a loved one has been injured, you owe it to yourself or to them to order a free copy of this book to help protect their rights.

When you are pursuing your claim, the insurance company is going to fight tooth and nail against you. Adjusters may argue that the accident wasn’t their insured’s fault, that you can’t be hurt in a low-impact collision or a “minor” fall, that you haven’t lost the income you have, or that you’re exaggerating your injuries. A good personal injury lawyer can deal with most of these claims. A good personal injury lawyer knows the keys to proving the true cause of the accident. A good personal injury lawyer knows the science of establishing that the injuries you sustain are unrelated to the physical damage of a car. A good personal injury lawyer knows proven tactics to rebut claims that you’re exaggerating your injuries. A good personal injury lawyer knows how to discredit the doctor that the insurance company will hire to say you’re not hurt. In most cases, a good personal injury lawyer is critical to your success.
