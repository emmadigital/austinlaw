## Texas Auto Injury Law

As an [auto accident attorney practicing in Austin, Texas](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/) for the last decade, I’ve had to help many people suffering through injuries, medical bills, lost income and sometimes facing eviction and starvation because of how someone’s carelessness has now impacted their lives.

Unfortunately, auto accidents occur too often because someone was being needlessly careless – distracted by their phone or child or another passenger. Sometimes it’s worse – the [driver is drunk or intoxicated](/practice-areas/drunk-driving-accident-lawyer/) or [texting or reading a book](/practice-areas/distracted-driver/). Other times, the driver is simply in a hurry and doesn’t realize that a several hundred pound chunk of steel moving at high velocity has substantial force – it’s simply mass times velocity equals force – and tragedy can occur.

Many crash victims, especially those with [neck injuries](/practice-areas/austin-soft-tissue-damage-attorneys/), have lifelong problems while a few lucky ones heal after a few months. In every case, vigorous fighting for our clients is involved which means not only knowing the law and the facts, but being able to counter the medical doctors the insurance companies hire to try make you out as a “lottery winner,” and keeping the jury focused on the truths and not the insurance defense lawyer lies.

Insurance companies are only interested in one thing – their profits. They see you as someone trying to decrease their profits. They don’t care if you were injured or how it has affected your life. They only care how they can get away with not paying you or how little they must pay. They only pay what you make them pay. It’s a zero-sum game to them, meaning someone has to win and someone has to lose. They’ll put those billions of dollars of insured’s money to make sure they win and not you.

The law is supposed to be the great equalizer. The wealth of the insurance company or the poverty of the auto accident victim shouldn’t matter. Unfortunately, the courts are no longer equal or fair to the injured party. Even with the one of the best Austin car accident lawyers, you’ll face laws that were changed in the last ten years with one goal in mind, to decrease your compensation and increase the insurance company savings.

Here are just two examples:

1. Insurance companies have in-house attorneys with names like **Susan Florence & Associates** or **The Law Office of Gregory V. DeBernard** (formerly The Law Offices of Kelly O’Connor). Why don’t the attorneys say they work for Allstate or USAA? Because the jury never gets to find out that the defendant has insurance who will pay the judgment. You don’t get to sue the insurance company, only the person who was careless, and so the fact that insurance is available will be hidden from the jury. Why do the insurance companies have in-house attorneys? To control costs. They pay them a fixed salary and don’t care if you file suit and go all the way to trial – the cost is the same to them.

2)Â You are better off having no insurance and arranging for funding for your treatment than if you have health insurance. Crazy but true. You would think the law would reward people for carrying health insurance and punish the person who carelessly hurt you. That used to be true, but not since 2003. Now, the careless person gets the discount your health insurance obtained for you – but in reality, the insurance company gets the benefit. This change alone has saved the insurance companies **billions of dollars**.
