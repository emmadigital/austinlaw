A man died and three other people were injured Friday night after a pickup hauling a 1998 utility trailer hit a car and then collided head-on with an SUV, Texas Department of Public Safety officials said.

The crash occured near the intersection of Texas 80 and FM 20, which is southeast of San Marcos at 6:56 when a 2001 Pontiac Sunfire facing south on Texas 80 was preparing to make a left-hand turn onto FM 20. The driver of a 2001 Ford pickup heading south on Texas 80 did not see that the Pontiac had stopped, swerved to the left and struck the driver’s side of the Pontiac before colliding head-on with a 2003 Ford Explorer traveling north on Texas 80.

The driver of the Ford Explorer, 26-year-old Steven Fuentes of Aransas Pass, was pronounced dead at the scene. A passanger, Maria Fuentes, 53, was taken to University Medical Center at Brackenridge, where she was in stable condition Saturday with a fractured right leg. Another passenger, 12-year-old Katelyn O’Bryant was also taken to Brackenridge and was listed in stable condition with abrasions.

Sue Morris, 43, of Fentress, who had been driving the Pontiac, was treated at the scene for minor injuries and there was no indication that the driver of the pickup, Timothy Willhoite, of Kingsbury, was injured in the wreck according to officials.
