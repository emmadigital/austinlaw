## Deadly Consequences

Nationwide, more than 15 people are killed and 1,200 injured **every day** in accidents involving distracted drivers, according to 2009 figures from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

If you have been injured by a distracted driver or if a family member suffered a [wrongful death](/practice-areas/wrongful-death-attorney/) because someone else made the decision to not pay attention, please contact an [Austin accident attorney](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/) at The Traub Law Office today for a free initial consultation and case evaluation.

Personal Injury Attorney Andrew Traub says: *“A distracted driver’s insurance company may try to make sure your injury claim is as lengthy, complicated, and expensive for you as possible. They may use intimidation to try and convince you not to pursue your claim and to discourage you from seeking the advice of an experienced trial attorney. Insurance companies often deny responsibility, even in cases of clear liability and outrageous conduct while the injured party’s family faces a lifetime of pain, suffering and financial loss. Victims of a distracted driver’s negligence owe it to themselves and to society to hold the distracted driver responsible.”*
