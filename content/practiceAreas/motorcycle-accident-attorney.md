Because motorcycles offer so little protection to riders, motorcycle accidents often involve [extremely serious injuries](/practice-areas/serious-personal-injury/), such as [brain injury](/practice-areas/brain-injury-lawyers/), [spinal cord injury](/practice-areas/austin-spinal-cord-injury-lawyers/), [multiple fractures](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/practice-areas/broken-bone-injury-attorneys/), and internal injuries. Motorcycle riders are 34 times more likely to be [killed in an accident](/practice-areas/wrongful-death-attorney/) than are occupants of a passenger vehicle, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

The *motorcycle accident attorneys* at the The Traub Law Office have seen the sometimes devastating injuries that result from motorcycle accidents, and we understand the [pain and debilitation](/faq/pain-and-suffering/). Let us handle your motorcycle insurance claims.

When the driver of a car or truck hits a motorcycle, there are often a lot of [broken bones](/practice-areas/austin-broken-bone-injury-attorneys/). Road rash (caused by skin scraping on a roadway) has the same pain and difficult recovery as a [burn injury](/practice-areas/burn-injury-lawyer/) like second- or third-degree burns.

## Common reasons we see for motorcycle crashes:

1. Most motorcycle accidents occur only a short distance from home. (i.e. shopping, errands, friends, entertainment or recreation, and the accident is likely to happen in a very short time close to the trip origin)
2. The failure of the other driver to see the motorcycle is the predominating cause of motorcycle accidents. The other driver typically fails to see the motorcycle before the collision or simply does not see the motorcycle until its too late to avoid the collision
3. Seventy-three percent of the riders who were involved in crashes used no eye protection. Wind on the eyes can cause impaired vision which can delay hazard detection and
4. Visibility of the motorcycle is a critical factor in the multiple vehicle accidents. Accidents are greatly reduced by the use of headlamps at all times and the use of brightly colored and visible jackets.

Are you getting good medical treatment? Road rash, broken bones, [traumatic brain injury (TBI)](/practice-areas/traumatic-brain-injuries-tbi/), and other [serious injuries](/practice-areas/serious-personal-injury/) need immediate treatment.

## Have you talked to an experienced **motorcycle accident attorney**?

Insurance adjusters seem concerned, but they are more concerned about profits than your injuries or your recovery. Let your lawyer do the talking and negotiating.

Are legal details distracting you from your recovery? Focusing on medical treatment and physical therapy takes time and energy. You may need occupational therapy to help you get back to work. We will tell you what your rights are.

[Does the insurance company understand how bad the accident was?](/faq/questions-you-should-ask-the-insurance-adjuster/) At our firm, we do an accident investigation to uncover all available facts. We present your case effectively. We mightÂ produce settlement videos demonstrating the extent of your injuries. If the insurance company does not settle fairly, an experienced trial lawyer from our firm presents your negligence case to a judge and jury.
