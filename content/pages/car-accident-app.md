The app has the following benefits for you:

**Accident Kit**

The accident kit helps you record information at the scene of an accident. Â It’s common to forget something important after an accident because the accident victim is shaken up, confused, or has adrenaline flowing through them. Â The kit has a simple step-by-step systemÂ which tells you want information to obtain and helps you gather and store it.

**Injury Resources**

The injury resources sectionÂ gives you guidance for both before and after you are involved in a collision.

**Emergency Services**

The emergency services area of the app helps you contact the police, EMS, tow trucks, fire trucks, etc including showing you which services are closest to where you are.

**My Data**

The My Data area of the app allows you to track your documents, expenses, and tasks after you’ve been in an accident. Â Simply take a photo of your document or bill and it will be uploaded and saved.
