Compensation for Soft Tissue Injuries

The Austin soft tissue damage attorneys of The Traub Law Office, P.C. have been successful with soft tissue injury cases (often called [whiplash](/faq/whiplash-injuries/)). Our experience and attention to detail enable us to get clients real money for these injuries. Insurers are less likely to fight a well-documented claim, and we pride ourselves on building the most comprehensive case possible – and we aren’t afraid to fight for you all the way to a jury verdict.

## What Is My Soft Tissue Injury Case Worth?

Scientific research shows that soft tissue injuries are often worse than they first appear. A “sore neck” might actually be a fractured vertebrae or serious ligament damage. A swollen knee might eventually require surgery. A “pulled muscle” in the back might keep a person out of work for months. In fact, studies show that, on average, 53% of people never recover from a soft-tissue injury.

Without an experienced lawyer on your side, the insurance companies are likely to either (a) flatly reject your soft tissue damage claim or (b) offer an immediate settlement that does not account for ongoing medical care or lasting disability.

Your lawyer also has to be willing to take your case to trial and show the evidence in front of a jury. For soft-tissue injuries, you will definitely want to chose a law firm where the lawyer will be interacting with you on a one-to-one basis. You don’t want to be dealing with a paralegal and you don’t want to hire a law firm where you are just one of hundreds of active cases. Why? Because often the “TV” lawyers take anything that comes in through the door, throw it at the wall, and if it sticks great, if not, they release the client and tell them it’s “not worth their time.” Read reviews for the TV lawyers and you’ll see this common theme.

We work with your doctors to diagnose the actual damage and document your claims for medical bills, lost income, pain and suffering. Rather than seek a “quickie” settlement, we ensure that you have reached maximum medical progress or that you are compensated for future medicals and lost earnings.
