A 7-year-old girl riding in the back seat of an SUV died Tuesday night after the vehicle was struck from behind by a pickup at a stoplight on RM 620 at Comanche Trail, near Lake Travis.

Josefina Delgado was pronounced dead at the scene about 30 minutes after the 8:33 p.m. collision, Department of Public Safety spokesman Michael Chernivec said. She was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the collision, he said. The drivers of both vehicles and two other passengers in the SUV were hospitalized with injuries that were not life-threatening, Chernivec said.

Chernivec said three people were taken to University Medical Center Brackenridge: Josefina’s mother, also named Josefina Delgado, 45; Francisco Gutierres, 59, who was driving the SUV; and the driver of the pickup, Michael Winders, 40. Bertha Delgado, 15, and Leonicio Delgado, 11, were taken to Dell Children’s Medical Center, he said.

Gutierres’ SUV was westbound on RM 620, stopped at a red light, when it was struck by Winders’ westbound pickup, Chernivec said. Investigators on Wednesday continued to investigate the circumstances of the collision. No citations have been issued, and no charges have been filed, he said.
