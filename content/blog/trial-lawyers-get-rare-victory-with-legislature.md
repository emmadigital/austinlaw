Handing a rare victory to personal injury trial lawyers, the Senate passed legislation that would make it easier for certain people to recover damages after being exposed to asbestos.

The bill, which passed 20-11 on a preliminary vote Thursday, would apply to lawsuits involving mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer usually caused by the inhalation of asbestos fibers.

The legislation, which faces more hurdles before becoming law, would set a lower standard of proof for demonstrating that asbestos exposure was significant enough to cause cancer.

No doubt, Rick Perry will veto it.
