San Marcos police are working to identify a driver who drove away after [fatally crashing into a pedestrian](/practice-areas/wrongful-death-attorney/) late Monday.

Police responded to the 1600 block of Post Road about 10 p.m. Monday, according to a statement from authorities. Dwight Garrett Thomas, 41, was walking with another man on the edge of a sidewalk or in a bicycle lane when he was struck by a vehicle, police said.

Thomas was taken to Ascension Seton Hays Hospital in Kyle, where he later died, the statement said.

Investigators said that based on evidence left at the scene, the vehicle is likely a maroon 2002 to 2005 Ford Explorer. The vehicle will be missing the right, front turn signal housing and possibly has the headlight broken.

“Our community has already helped us identify one hit and run driver this year,” said interim Police Chief Bob Klett. “We are asking witnesses and anyone who recognizes the vehicle description to come forward and help us solve this crime.”

Anyone with any information about the driver or vehicle is asked to contact Sgt. Sam Myers at 512-753-2182.
