A new state law that is going into effect on September 1, 2009 is restricting the use of cell phones in school zones. However, the only way to enforce this new law is by installing signs notifying drivers of the new law because the absence of signs is a defense against prosecution. This law is very flexible because if the city doesn’t have money to put the signs up then there is no penalty. However, the law makers plan on trying to make the law not so optional in their next session. Some think that it’s not worth the amount of money it would cost to put up all those signs. For example, for Austin they would invest $80,000 installing signs warning of a $200 fine. On the other hand many people are adamant that the safety of the kids and drivers is worth that much and much more.
