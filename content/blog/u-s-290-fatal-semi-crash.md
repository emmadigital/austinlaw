## 3 killed in crash with semi on U.S. 290

Three people were killed Tuesday morning in a collision on U.S. 290 at the intersection with Roy Davis Road, just east of Elgin, authorities said.

According to a preliminary investigation by the Texas Department of Public Safety, a Chevy Tahoe carrying three people [crashed into a semi](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/practice-areas/truck-accident-lawyer/) that was trying to turn onto Roy Davis around 6:20 a.m.

The Tahoeâ€™s driver and two [occupants were killed](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/practice-areas/wrongful-death-attorney/). Authorities said the semi [failed to yield](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/practice-areas/negligence/) as it was making a wide left turn.

Both vehicles were traveling east but the crash forced authorities to close the westbound lanes of U.S. 290 for about five hours as emergency crews cleared the wreck and investigators worked at the scene.
