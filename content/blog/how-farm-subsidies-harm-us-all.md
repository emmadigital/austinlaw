This is off topic, but a friend just sent me this info which shows our government at work:

Among farmers eligible for subsidies, just 10 percent of recipients collect 73 percent of the subsidies an average of $91,000 per farm. (See Chart 3.) By contrast, the average subsidy granted to the bottom 80 percent of recipients is less than $3,000 annually.

According to the USDA, the majority of farm subsidies are distributed to commercial farms, which have an average household income of $199,975 and a net worth of just under $2 million.

Celebrity “hobby farmers” such as David Rockefeller ($553,782); Ted Turner ($206,948); and Scottie Pippen ($210,520).

Does Ted Turner really need my money?
