Two recent [bicycle fatalities](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/practice-areas/wrongful-death-attorney/) couldâ€™ve been prevented if the roads where the victims were struck had been more accommodating to cyclists, local organization Bike Austin said Wednesday.

â€œBoth of these crashes took place on major roadways with little or no accommodations for bicyclists and pedestrians,â€ a statement from the organization said.

On Tuesday evening, a bicyclist who police have not yet identified died at South First and West Mary streets after he was hit by someone driving a car around 7:25 p.m., Austin police have said. There was also a car crash at that same location that morning.

On March 14, 53-year-old Charlie Bunton Jr. died after he was hit around 11:45 p.m. while riding his bicycle on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard just east of Springdale Road. The driver, Joshua Christopher Brosemer, 38, was arrested under suspicion of [drunken driving](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/practice-areas/drunk-driving-accident-lawyer/), Austin police said.

In its statement, Bike Austin members expressed their condolences to the families of those killed and urged Austin officials to â€œhasten the build out of the [Bicycle and Sidewalk master plans](http://austintexas.gov/page/2016-bond-programs-and-projects) to prevent future tragedies.â€
