The American Association for Justice has published an interesting and helpful article titled [Tricks of the Trade: How Insurance Companies Deny, Delay, Confuse and Refuse](https://app.bronto.com/public/?q=ulink&fn=Link&ssid=591&id=ko0g7xsx9pyv0ja2ixnhyyh9yhblf&id2=f458c8jq8lmcxfbjg7d88c12hkauh "http\://app.bronto.com/public/?q=ulink&fn=Link&ssid=591&id=ko0g7xsx9pyv0ja2ixnhyyh9yhblf&id2=f458c8jq8lmcxfbjg7d88c12hkauh"). The topics include: Denying Claims, Delaying Until Death, Confusing Consumers, Abandoning the Sick, Discriminating by Credit Score, and Canceling for a Call.



Here is the summary of the article â€” What you can do about these tactics:

> *READ YOUR POLICY CAREFULLY:* You should know exactly what is covered and how to appeal a denial by your insurance company.
>
> *BE VERY CAREFUL FILLING OUT FORMS:* Even if you make an honest mistake your insurance company may seize on that as a reason to retroactively deny your coverage.
>
> *DO NOT CASH A PREMIUM REFUND CHECK:* If your insurance company cancels your insurance when you make a claim, they may send you a check for premiums paid. Cashing it may act as accepting their decision.
>
> *PUT EVERYTHING IN WRITING:* Calling your insurance company is likely to be a frustrating experience, and you will not be able to prove anything that a company representative tells you over the phone. Keep records of all bills and correspondence.
>
> *CONTACT YOUR STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT:* They may be able to help you. But they will not represent you in a private matter, so if all else fails you may need to consult with an attorney.
>
> *AND MOST OF ALL, DO NOT GIVE UP:* Insurance companies count on you giving up. Fight for your rights.
