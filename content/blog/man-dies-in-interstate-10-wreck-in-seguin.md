A Canyon Lake man died Friday after a wreck on Interstate 10 near Seguin, Department of Public Safety officials said.

Officials reported that Jason Kline, 38, was driving a Ford pickup west on I-10 when a tractor-trailer hydroplaned and skidded through the median into oncoming traffic.

The trailer struck Klineâ€™s truck, and he died at the scene, officials said.

The driver of the tractor-trailer was in good condition Sunday at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, officials said.
