## Guides List

**Guides** is a non-medical term used to describe neck pain following an injury to the soft tissues of your neck (specifically ligaments, tendons, and muscles). A doctor may use the more specific terms of cervical sprain, cervical strain, or hyper extension injury. It is caused by an accidental motion or force applied to your neck which results in movement beyond the neck's normal range of motion.
