A 64-year-old woman was killed Thursday night when she was hit by a vehicle while crossing a street in Northeast Austin.

The woman was crossing Cameron Road mid-block near St. Johns Avenue on Friday at 7:36 p.m. when she was struck by a 1999 GM pickup in the southbound right lane. She was pronounced dead en route to the hospital.

Neither alcohol nor speed seemed to be factors in the incident and the pickup driver remained at the scene.

Anyone with information is asked to call vehicular homicide unit detectives at (512) 974-4724.
