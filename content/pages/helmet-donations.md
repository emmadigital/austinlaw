Every helmet can keep a child safe from a head injury. â€œItâ€™s our hope that these helmets will reduce or eliminate the risk of head injuries in children on a bicycle,â€ said Andrew.

According to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, Cycling was the top sport for head injuries for kids under ages 14 and under.

Currently, Texas does not have a statewide helmet law. As a general matter, it is legal for all persons of any age to operate a bicycle without wearing a helmet unless otherwise provided by a municipal regulation. However, cities such as Austin, Houston, and Ft. Worth have passed mandatory helmet laws for children under 18.

According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, based on 2015 data released in June 2017 and still the most recent data:

* 818 bicyclists died on US roads in 2015, an increase of 12.2 per cent and the highest number since 1995. (It was 1,003 back in 1975)
* 45,000 bicyclists were injured in traffic 1n 2015, down 10 per cent from 50,000 in 2014 (52,000 in 2010)
* 37 Bicyclists 14 and under (7% of total) were killed in 2015. 5,000 were injured.

[Ghisallo Cycling Initiative](http://ghisallo.org/) provides semester-long, after-school Bike Clubs with weekly bicycle maintenance and riding classes as well as an Earn-A-Bike program, Bicycle Rodeos, and maintenance and safety clinics. The majority of their participants are low-income, at-risk students.

Letâ€™s keep kids safe!!!
