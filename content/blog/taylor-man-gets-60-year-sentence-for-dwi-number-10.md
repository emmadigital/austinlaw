A Taylor man, Anthony Lynn Falco, was sentenced to 60 years in prison Wednesday for his 10th driving while intoxicated conviction.

Mr. Falco was pulled over in June and told police that he had been drinking beer at a Round Rock bar, failed field sobriety tests but refused to give a breath sample. After a blood search warrant was obtained, the sample showed he had more than two times the legal limit of alcohol in his blood.

Mr. Falco pleaded guilty to felony DWI in January and waived his right to a jury trial. District Judge Burt Carnes then sentenced him to 60 years in prison making him eligible for parole in 15 years.

According to Williamson County District Attorney John Bradley, Mr. Falco had nine previous DWI convictions starting in 1979. He served time for the last three.

Mr. Bradley said that convicted DWI offenders like Falco should have to give a breath or blood sample and urged state legislators to pass such a law.
