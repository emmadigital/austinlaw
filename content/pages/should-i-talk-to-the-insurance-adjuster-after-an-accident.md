While you can, **we don’t always recommend it following a serious accident**.

The insurance adjuster is calling to get you to make statements (usually it is a recorded call) about the events leading up to and including the accident.

They will also ask you about your injuries and whether you went to a hospital or a doctor following the accident.

While it may seem innocent enough, the problem with talking to an insurance adjuster after a serious accident is that the adjuster is actually **probing and looking for ways to minimize their liability, either through putting blame on you or through finding ways to blame your injuries on a prior problem or finding out that you’ve been seeing a doctor for a similar complaint before.Â** They can then use your statement against you at a later time should you bring a lawsuit against the driver or owner of the other car invovled in your accident.

If an insurance adjuster calls to talk to you, **tell them you’ll be happy to speak to them, after you speak with your** attorney.
