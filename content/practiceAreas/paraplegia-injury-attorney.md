## Paralysis damages lives in many ways

If an injury resulting in paralysis for you or someone you care about was the result of another person’s carelessness, the paralyzed person may be entitled to seek compensation in the forms of past and future medical care (including assistance with daily living and chores), [lost wages in the past and lost earning capacity in the future](/lost-wages-due-to-an-injury/), and the inability to enjoy life as the person had before. This type of injury is not only life-changing for the victim, but also for his or her loved ones as well. A full estimate of care needs requires the hiring of expensive experts so that full and adequate compensation can be recovered.

### What is paraplegia?

Paraplegia is a form of paralysis that impairs a person’s ability to move from the waist down. A person suffering from quadriplegia is paralyzed from the neck down. For a previously able-bodied person, becoming paralyzed can be one of the most devastating types of injuries. Not only are there the obvious physical limitations imposed on the victim, but he or she will often suffer from severe depression, withdrawal. All of these changes affect everyone around the victim who are suddenly thrust into the role of caregivers.

Paralysis usually results from the severing of the spinal cord.
