Lynda Mescher, the owner of a Spicewood horse camp, was indicted by a Burnet County grand jury Tuesday on manslaughter and injury to a child charges in connection with a January incident in which a pickup she was driving rolled over and killed an 11-year-old-girl.

Mescher, 47, was carrying Brianna Plehn of Briarcliff along with five other children in the bed of her pickup when it rolled over at the Grelle Recreation Area on Lake Travis in Burnet County. Brianna was pronounced dead at the scene. The other children and Mescher were injured and taken to the area hospital. Also seriously injured was Megan Proctor, 11, according to the arrest affidavit.

Mescher runs Silverâ€™s Trails, a hors-riding ranch in Spicewood where Brianna was attending a weekend camping trip. Her 8-year-old brother, Dylan, was also in the truck.

It is illegal in most circumstances to allow people younger than 18 to ride in the bed of a pickup.

There is no evidence to suggest Mescher was intoxicated or speeding when the wreck occurred.
