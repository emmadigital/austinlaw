Three people were hospitalized with [burn injuries](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/practice-areas/burn-injury-lawyer/). A Saturday night after a fire erupted in a rented party at on Lake Travis, accord to Lake Travis Fire and Rescue.

Nine people on board had docked the rented boat on Starnes Island when the boat’s power generator began malfunctioning, a fire official said. A man began working on the generator at the back of the boat with two women nearby when a “flash fire” erupted, said Lt. Jonathan Bohot with Lake Travis Fire and Rescue.

Rescue crews took the three victims to Emerald Point, where at least one was flown via a STAR Flight helicopter to the Dell Seton Medical Center. One woman sustained second- and [third-degree burns](https://www.austinaccidentlawyer.com/practice-areas/burn-injury-lawyer/) while two others suffered burns to their lower extremities.

The Travis County Fire Marshal is leading an investigation into the cause of the fire.
