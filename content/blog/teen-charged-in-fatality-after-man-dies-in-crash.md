An 18-year-old was arrested and charged with criminally negligent homicide after a fatal wreck in Lakeway on Saturday left another man dead. The charge is a state jail felony, which carries a maximum penalty of two years if he is convicted.

Siji Alfredo Moreno was driving a Chevy pickup South on RM 620 about 8:30 a.m. when, witnesses told Lakeway police, Moreno’s pickup drifted across the center turn lane and into the northbound lane, according to an affidavit. Moreno’s truck struck a four-door Toyota Corolla that John Gregory was riding in, the affidavit said.

Gregory and his wife Carolyn, who was driving, were flown to University Medical Center Brackenridge in Austin; Moreno was taken in an ambulance, the affidavit says. John Gregory died from his injuries later that day. Carolyn Gregory was in intensive care Tuesday night. A passenger in the truck did not suffer serious injuries, the affidavit said.

Moreno was in the Travis County. Jail with bail set at $250,000. Lakeway police said the investigation into the wreck is ongoing.
