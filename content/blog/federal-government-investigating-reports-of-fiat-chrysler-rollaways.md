The U.S. auto safety agency has opened an investigation into complaints that another 1 million Fiat Chrysler vehicles can roll away after the owners shift transmissions into park, a problem similar to the one being blamed in the [wrongful death](/practice-areas/wrongful-death-attorney/) of “Star Trek” actor Anton Yelchin.

The investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration covers Fiat Chrysler’s top-selling vehicle, the Ram 1500 pickup, from the 2013 to 2016 model years, as well as the 2014 to 2016 Dodge Durango SUV. The rollaway complaints are similar to those that prompted the recall of 1.1 million Jeep Grand Cherokees and other vehicles earlier this year, although those vehicles have different shifters.

Yelchin, 27, known for playing Chekov in the film series, died in June after his 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee pinned him against a mailbox pillar and security fence at his home in Los Angeles. His Jeep was among the [vehicles recalled](/practice-areas/product-defect-lawyer/) in April because of complaints from drivers who had trouble telling if they put the console-mounted shift levers in “park” after stopping. Many reported that the vehicles rolled off after the driver exited. Los Angeles police are still investigating Yelchin’s death.

In the new investigation, the government says Rams and Durangos have dial-like rotary knob shifters that are linked electronically to the transmission. The knobs are turned to the left or right and click into gear.

But the government said in documents posted Tuesday that it received 43 complaints alleging that the [vehicles rolled away unexpectedly](/practice-areas/product-defect-lawyer/). Owners reported 25 crashes and nine injuries. Thirty-four of the owners alleged that the vehicles moved while the shifters were in park, and most said the engines were running.

“Notably, none of the reports indicate that the parking bake was engaged at the time of the roll-away incident,” NHTSA said in the documents. Fiat Chrysler is urging drivers to always use parking brakes when they stop vehicles.

Both Fiat Chrysler shifters are different from conventional levers on the steering column or console. Most cars have console shifters that slide forward or backward to indicate the car’s gear. They used to be tied to a cable that physically changed gears. But the industry has developed new transmissions with the gear selection controlled electronically.
