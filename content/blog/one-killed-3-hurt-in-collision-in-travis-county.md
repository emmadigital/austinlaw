One man was killed and three people were injured in a head-on collision Tuesday night on Texas 71 in Travis County, the Texas Department of Public Safety reported Wednesday.

The collision occured about 9 p.m. in the 9400 block of Texas 71 near Old Bee Cave Road. A dispatcher with DPS said a 2000 Mitsubishi driven by Steve Mester of Austin was in the eastbound turning lane when a westbound 1989 Chevrolet two-door car hit Mesterâ€™s car.

The driver of the Chevrolet was pronounced dead at the scene, and officials said he was not wearing a seat belt. He has not been identified yet, pending notification of next of kin.

Mester, Lisa Mester, and Claire Mabru, who were in the Mitsubishi, were taken to University Medical Center at Brackenridge with serious injuries, but they were in stable condition, officials said.
