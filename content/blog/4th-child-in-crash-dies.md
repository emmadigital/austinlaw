A 6-year-old girl who had been in critical condition at Dell Children’s Medical Center after a wreck in Bastrop County last weekend died Friday morning.

Angie Gonzalez of Houston was riding in a van with four other children and two adults last Sunday afternoon when the driver failed to yield to a pickup while turning onto Texas 21 from U.S. 290.

Three other children – Leah Gonzalez, 5, Noel Gonzalez, 8, and Paul Gonzalez, 9 – died at the scene.Two adults were taken to University Medical Center Brackenridge and released shortly after. Apolinar Saldana, 1, and Angie Gonzalez were taken to Dell Children’s as well. Saldana was released on Friday.

Apparently, only one person was wearing a seat belt and the 1-year-old was in a car seat.I don’t know why the other children weren’t in boosters or seat belts.
