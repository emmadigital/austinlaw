A construction worker was killed in a crash on southbound Interstate 35 about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday.\
Police said a dark-colored SUV ran through a clearly marked construction zone and hit Fontino Cortes-Cruz, 36, in the 11400 block of 1-35 near Onion Creek Parkway. The driver fled; nobody else was injured, police said.\
The SUV drove south after the crash, and Austin police notified Hays County officials to be on the lookout for the vehicle, Austin police Sgt. Richard Stresing said. Hays County sheriffâ€™s deputies found a burned dark-colored SUV outside of Kyle about 4 a.m., Stresing said, and shortly afterward, police received a call from South Austin Hospital that a man with burns on his body had checked into the hospital.\
Police are interviewing him as a person of interest in the crash, Stresing said.\
Cortes-Cruz was part of a crew that was repaving the interstate, said Marcus Cooper, spokesman for the Texas Department of Transportation. He had been laying reflective tabs on the highway when he was hit, Cooper said.
