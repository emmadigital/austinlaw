Officials say an 18-year-old El Paso man, apparently angry about being asked to leave a gathering, drove his car into a crowd in a parking area. Two male teenagers were injured but are expected to recover.

The El Paso County sheriffâ€™s office said Sunday that a 17-year-old was pinned under the car and a 16-year-old was struck and suffered broken leg.

Witnesses said the driver in the early Saturday incident had to be forced out of the car so the 17-year-old could be pulled out from under it. The 17-year-old suffered bruising and internal injuries.

The driver was jailed on two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.
